<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>My opposition to injustice, imposition, discrimination
and prejudice, which have for many years
existed against the colored people of the South, has
led to this little book. In many parts of America
the press has been furnished with “matter” for
defending the colored people, through the medium of
“Coleman’s Illustrated Lectures.” By request of my
many auditors, some of whom being leading elements
of the Northern States and Canada, this volume is
published. Many persons interested in the welfare
of the negro, have sought a more elaborate book on
the Southern horrors. Therefore, the manner in
which the colored people are treated, and the laws
devised against them from time to time, are the chief
subjects.</p>

<p>My endeavour to furnish those concerned in
human welfare, with Southern railroad affairs, lynchings,
etc., so far as the so-called law governing the
white and black races is concerned, is evinced in the
experience of eight years touring on various lines
throughout the South. My statements being authentic
and impartial, I have noted some incidents
occurring on roads which I have travelled, amid
peculiar circumstances, which I hope will prove serviceable
to the reader. I have quoted Bishop Turner’s
“Supreme Court Decision,” and Mrs. Ida B.
Wells Barnett’s “The Reason Why,” largely because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
they contain facts <em>agreeing</em> very much with my experience
and judgment. Opinions of leading Afro-American
journals have been expressed as a unanimous
sentiment of the race, regarding their loyalty
to the flag under which they live and serve. The
main object of this book is to create within the hearts
of those who may read it, sympathy for the colored
people of the South. So many unreasonable things
have been alleged against the negro, that he now
demands a reasonable <em>consideration</em>.</p>

<p>The Southern press has made scores of enemies
for the entire race, and continues doing so. The
“Rape” Bell has been sounded all over the world to
degrade the negro and impede his rapid progress.
Why did the negro not commit “rape” during his
dark days of slavery? In slavery he was not allowed
to know A from B, or 1 from 2. This means that a
slave was esteemed a little higher than the cattle.
Slavery is illiteracy. “God is a jealous God, visiting
the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the
third and fourth generation of them that hate Him.”
“The people of the Southern States have enslaved the
colored people; for 250 years held them a small degree
above the dumb brute. To-day they lynch the negro,
burn him, and refuse him justice on railway cars.
God will visit the Americans. If not the 3rd generation,
the 4th will be made repent, and humiliate to
the black man.”—<cite>Rev. J. C. Tolmie, B.A.</cite></p>

<p>The fact that there are in the South about 20,000
teachers, 238,000 scholars, 150 schools for advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
education, and seven colleges with negro faculty, is
sufficient proof itself that the current reports of
“rape” are not true. There are about 8,000,000
colored people in the United States, and about half
that number are Church goers, which proportionately
far exceeds their white brethren. The people who
have been prejudiced against the colored race by
Southern newspapers, have never considered that
there are no daily papers managed by the colored
people to defend their side of the case. The weekly
papers of colored editorship are not read by the
white race. Then how can the considerate people
who would know of the perpetual reports, arrive at a
definite conclusion as to whether they are right or
wrong? There are two sides to a case, and each side
deserves scrutineering. No just judge will hear the
plaintiff, and drive the defendant from the Court
room door. <em>Negro</em> rights have been advocated, and
are now being advocated by the British press, and by
true, sympathetic ministers of the gospel of both the
North and South. I pray that such a thirsting after
righteousness will emanate from the Churches in
America that will cause the world to see that Christianity
predominates from the chilly plains of the
North to the smoky regions of the South.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>Rev. J. Clay Coleman was born 4 miles south of
Durant, Holmes Co., Mississippi, Feb. 1st, 1876.
Lived in Goodman, Holmes Co., Miss., until 1888.
His parents were slaves on Tome Bigbee River, Alabama,
a number of years, and afterwards sold to
Botus, at Lexington, Holmes Co., Miss.; from Botus
to Fletcher Harrington, at Goodman.</p>

<p>Peter Coleman, the father of J. C. Coleman, was
very much devoted to his family, and took care to
see that each of his seven children was to some extent
educated. John Clay Coleman proceeded to the study
of law; but by divine providence he was led to the
study of the Bible, and became a minister and
travelling Biblical illustrating lecturer. Mr. Coleman
and the bulk of his relatives are Methodists, the
majority of whom being members of the same
Church at Georgeville, Miss. Mrs. Rowena Coleman,
the faithful mother of Mr. Coleman, prayed that his
calling would be to preach the gospel. Her fervent
prayers are heard and answered. In 1887, J. C.
Coleman had the management of the country mail
route from Goodman to Cocksburg, Miss. Began
travelling as lecturer in 1888. In 1892 he travelled
the south through; visited the Columbian Exposition
at Chicago in 1893, and appeared at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Turkish Panorama of the Holy Land, in the interest
of “Coleman’s Great Biblical Exhibition.” This
unique exhibition was methodized by Mr. Coleman
in his youth, and had developed at this crisis into the
most instructive mode of illustrating the Scriptures
to Bible students. His liberality toward different
institutions the past eight years has marked him a
philanthropist. He has sacrificed time, talent, and
“earthly store” to the advancement of his people.
When leaving the World’s Columbian Exposition in
1893, he was fully determined to impart his remaining
years to missionary work in Africa. He entered
Canada in the “power of the Holy Spirit,” was
ordained minister of the gospel at the Annual Conference
of the A. M. E. Church, by Bishop H. M.
Turner, at Windsor, Ont., Sept. 1st, 1895. Married
Miss Hattie E. Johnson, of Halifax, N. S. Matrimony
performed by Rev. James M. Henderson, M.A.,
D.D., President of Morris Brown College, Atlanta,
Ga., Jan. 17th, 1894.</p>

<p>His wife being a consistent Church woman, has
added well to his success in the ministry. He was
educated for the ministry at Victoria University,
Toronto, Ont., being the first colored student in this
great University since its establishment in the City
of Toronto. He was received with a cordial cheering.</p>

<p>His fame as an illustrating lecturer is extensive.
Having collected from the Southern Horrors scenic
views, and resplendently presented them by use of
stereopticons before immense audiences, chiefly white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
people, who desired direct and accurate information
of the condition of the “negro in the South,” Mr.
Coleman has caused a sensation everywhere seen and
heard. Persons have arose after his lectures and
said, “Mr. Chairman, I move that a vote of thanks
be tendered Professor Coleman for his excellent
lecture and impressive views on the progress of the
colored people in the Southern States. He has
indeed given us facts concerning the outrages on the
people of his nationality, illustrated by pictures taken
from natural life.” Voices could be heard exclaiming,
“Hear! hear!!” in all parts of the audience.
Amid these demonstrations a unanimous vote would
be rendered, and an immediate protest against the
unfair burdens lavished upon the negro in the South
would warmly ensue.</p>

<p>Mr. Coleman learned in his early public career,
that the negro journals were not read by white
people, and it was his highest ambition to carry the
news to them. He is not, therefore, as prominent in
his own race as he would be had he confined himself
solely to them. That the Rev. Mr. Coleman is an
original race man, is evidently seen in some notes on
his boyhood traits, and his continuous advancement
to a renowned defender of peace, prosperity, and race
protection, both home and abroad. The leading
elements of Goodman attest these facts in a meeting
held in 1888, in honor of his departure: “We the
undersigned citizens of Goodman know Prof. John
C. Coleman to be a polite and inoffensive gentleman.
We further know him to be of religious and high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
moral character, and trustworthy in all of his dealings.
We hope his aim set forth, to achieve greater
victories for his people, will be successfully accomplished.

<h1>THE JIM CROW CAR.</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Eight Years’ Travel—General Observation—Inferior
Accommodation—Discrimination—Imposition—Ignorance
of Decency—Prejudice Occupies
the Highest Seat—Christianity Silent.</span></p>

</div>

<p>During eight years’ travel on different railroads
in the Southern States, I strictly observed:</p>

<p>1. That it is the duty of employees to see that
inferior accommodations in every “colored” car, and
in every “colored” waiting room be arranged. This
unjust measure is heretically endorsed by the white
passengers of all classes.</p>

<p>2. That Discrimination between the white and
black races is designed by “law,” and rigidly enforced
on the colored passenger, and a mere sham to the
white passenger.</p>

<p>3. That Imposition upon the colored passenger,
in the filthiest, smoky and inferior cars is participated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
in by the “highest white gentleman” and the lowest
“ignoramus Hill Billy.”</p>

<p>4. That <em>Ignorance</em> of Decency, politeness,
modesty and morality of the colored passenger is
maintained.</p>

<p>5. That Prejudice against the negro race, regardless
of characteristics, prevails in general officers—brakemen
and depot agents—and in case of a law
suit for that which is actually and properly due, it
occupies the highest seat in the Court room.</p>

<p>6. That a Christian minister is forced to smoke
and associate with the worst of humanity, by his
white brother. Christianity in this respect is inconsistent
with that preached and practiced in India,
China, Japan and Africa.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Early Experience.</span></h3>

<p>About one mile from the Coleman plantation
lived Mrs. Covington, commonly known as “the
Widow Covington.” She owned about 300 acres of
cultivated and uncultivated land, left to her by her
deceased husband. The land being valued at from
one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre to ten
dollars per acre, as most southern “sage” ground,
placed her in poor circumstances. Her surroundings
put her in the estimation of her colored neighbors
nothing more than “poor white trash.” On account
of her declining condition, my father, who was
extremely liberal, sent me to the Widow Covington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to assist her in gardening. It was a source of happiness
to be away from home, and more especially to
visit a white person’s house for the first time. Just
as I left my father’s arms with a kiss and “good
bye,” he exclaimed, “Be a good boy!” As I walked
along the rocky pathway, ascending and descending
the lofty hills, a constant voice, so tender and penetrating,
seemed to re-echo the words of my beloved
father, “Be a good boy.” Appearing at the widow’s
gate, the customary salutation, “Hello,” was yelled
out. Being told to come in, I briskly attempted to
step in at the front door, when I was abruptly told,
“Go around the back way.” This I readily did,
thinking that preparations were being made to entertain
the guest in the front room. I was given a seat
in the kitchen, which was both kitchen and dining
room, being tosted over toward the north, leaving
several spaces large enough for the cook to have
chicken visitors during meal hours. When dinner
was prepared, the little colored guest was left to partake
of the fragments on a separate table. This
action being so inhuman, I asked the widow why did
she not ask me to the front room, and before going
to dinner send me to the toilet room, and let all sit
at one table, as there was so much vacancy at her
table. The widow displayed no small degree of
madness in her response. “I want you to know that
you are a nigger, and you must stay in a nigger’s
place.”</p>

<p>It is to be seen from this that a black man is
thought to be inferior to a white man, and should for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
this reason be treated as such. The widow’s conception
of a “nigger’s place” is a mouthpiece for the
entire South. You might ask, Why is it that Mr. A.
is on board of train No. 3, en route for New Orleans,
occupying a car with all the modern accommodations;
and Mr. B. on the same train, en route for the
same place, having paid the same fare, and occupying
a car with split bottomed seats? Tobacco juice and
smoke have given it a new coat of painting and
deathly odor. Mr. A. puts his valise in Mr. B.’s car;
smoke, whistle, dance, drink intoxicants, and then
return to his pleasant, modernly furnished car. The
answer would be, Mr. A. is white and Mr. B. is black,
for this reason the employees have assigned Mr. B.
to an inferior car, in order that Mr. B. may remain in
a “nigger’s place.”</p>

<p>Thirty-three years have passed since the gloomy
clouds of slavery banished, and made way for the
negro to see his place—In the school room; in the
Legislature, Senate, Congress, Ministers to Republics,
Registry of Deeds, Registry of the Treasury, Law,
Doctors, Ministers of the Gospel, Bishopric, U. S.
Chaplaincy, Editors, Authors, Merchants, and Industry.
Now let us see why is it that a dungeon is
dug for a “nigger’s place.” Certainly the negro has
harmed no one. Not any more so than the horse
stolen from his master. The reason why the white
man is at enmity against the black man is, that the
white man once owned the black man. Millions of
dollars were expended on the purchase of slaves
when the war of 1860-’65 began. The purchasers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
it is claimed, had not then received one-half expended
on slavery. For this very cause the negro is
regarded as worthless property. The white boy has
the example of thievishness and slothfulness established
by his parents. He is taught that swindling
his colored brother is the way his parents came in
possession of their wealth, and to work is taking the
“nigger’s place.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">DISCRIMINATION.</span></h2>

<p>The Jim Crow Car, as the negro’s first grievance
relative to the Southern railroad system, is obviously
seen in the foregoing observation. There we see
that the matter of being separated from the white
passenger “cuts no figure,” but the very fact that
colored passenger is robbed out of the worth of his
well earned money, is the direct reason why the
victimized colored passenger appeals to the conscience
of those who have power and influence to abolish his
present outraged condition.</p>

<p>To get the proper understanding of the cause of
discrimination on Southern railroad cars, let us read
the following clippings from that great Southern
hero, statesman, and renowned Bishop H. M. Turner,
D.D., LL.D., D.C.L. From this, we hope to reach a
definite conclusion as to whether the fundamental
course of discrimination can be suppressed by the
enactment of “law.” First of all the Civil Rights
Bill is before us for consideration. It has blinded
the most studious and philanthropic men and women
within the British Empire, and the civilized world.
Those who meditate on the negro’s condition, and
sympathize with his environment, and who would
attempt to assist him, are led to doubt some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
current reports against the race, believing that the
Civil Rights Bill has imparted privileges to all men
alike, and therefore the black man has a right to
make use of equal enjoyment of citizenship.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3><span class="smcap">The Civil Rights Bill, which was Destroyed

and legal rights.</p>

<p><em>Whereas</em>, It is essential to just government, we
recognize the equality of all men before the law, and
hold that it is the duty of government in its dealings
with the people to mete out equal and exact justice
to all, of whatever nativity, race, color or persuasion,
religious or political; and it being the appropriate
object of legislation to enact great fundamental principles
into law; therefore,</p>

<p><em>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives

<p>The “Civil Rights Bill” comes secondary to
the emancipation. The bands of an unappalled
monster, and disgrace upon a civilized nation, gave
way for a better hope for the colored race in 1865.
The life and conduct of the once bonded slave proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
within a few years to be equal with his white brethren,
and far better than some of his worst oppressors.
The general characteristics of the negro, his rapid
progress, devotion to his Church, and loyalty to the
United States Government, and able achievements
in war, demanded a Civil Rights Bill. When slavery,
which was death to the colored race, was abolished,
the Civil Rights Bill gave them a remedy to <span class="smcap">live</span>.
The following will prove conclusively that the present
state of discrimination has not only hereditary origin,
but also sanctioned by the Supreme Court:—</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Civil Rights—Constitution—District of Columbia—Inns—Places
of Amusement—Public Conveyances—Slavery—Territories.</i></p>

<p class="hanging">1. The 1st and 2nd sections of the Civil Rights Act
passed March 1st, 1875, are unconstitutional
enactments as applied to the several States, not
being authorized either by the XIIIth or XIVth
Amendments of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. The XIVth Amendment is prohibitory upon the
States only, and the legislation authorized to be
adopted by Congress for enforcing it is not <em>direct</em>
legislation on the matters respecting which the
States are prohibited from making or enforcing
certain laws, or doing certain acts, but it is
<em>corrective</em> legislation, such as may be necessary
or proper for counteracting and redressing the
effects of such laws or acts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging">3. The XIIIth Amendment relates to slavery and
involuntary servitude (which it abolishes); and
although, by its reflex action, it establishes universal
freedom in the United States, and Congress
may probably pass laws directly enforcing
its provisions; yet such legislative power extends
only to the subject of slavery and its incidents;
and the denial of equal accommodations in inns,
public conveyances and places of public amusement
(which is forbidden by the sections in question),
imposes no badge of slavery or involuntary
servitude upon the party, but at most, infringes
rights which are protected from State aggression
by the XIVth Amendment.</p>

<p class="hanging">4. Whether the accommodations and privileges
sought to be protected by the 1st and 2nd sections
of the Civil Rights Act are, or are not
rights constitutionally demandable; and if they
are, in what form they are to be protected is not
now decided.</p>

<p class="hanging">5. Nor is it decided whether the law as it stands is
operative in the Territories and District of Columbia:
the decision only relating to its validity
as applied to States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>These cases were all founded on the first and
second sections of the Act of Congress, known as the
Civil Rights Act, passed March 1st, 1875, entitled,
“An Act to protect all citizens in their civil and legal
rights.” 18 Stat. 335. Two of the cases, those
against Stanley and Nichols, were indictments for
denying to persons of color the accommodations and
privileges of an inn or hotel; two of them, those
against Ryan and Singleton, were, one on information,
the other an indictment, for denying to individuals
the privileges and accommodations of a
theatre, the information against Ryan being for
refusing a colored person a seat in the dress circle of
Maguire’s theatre in San Francisco; and the indictment
against Singleton was for denying to another
person, whose color was not stated, the full enjoyment
of the accommodations of the theatre known as the
Grand Opera House in New York, “said denial not
being made for any reasons by law applicable to
citizens of every race and color, and regardless of
any previous condition of servitude.” The case of
Robinson and wife against the Memphis and Charleston
R. R. Company, was an action brought in the
Circuit Court of the United States for the Western
District of Tennessee, to recover the penalty of five
hundred dollars given by the second section of the
act; and the gravamen was the refusal by the conductor
of the railroad company to allow the wife to
ride in the ladies’ car, for the reason, as stated in one
of the counts, that she was a person of African
descent. The jury rendered a verdict for the defendants
in this case upon the merits, under a charge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the court, to which a bill of exceptions was taken by
the plaintiffs. The case was tried on the assumption
by both parties of the validity of the act of Congress;
and the principal point made by the exceptions was,
that the judge allowed evidence to go to the jury
tending to show that the conductor had reason to
suspect that the plaintiff, the wife, was an improper
person, because she was in company with a young
man whom he supposed to be a white man, and on
that account inferred that there was some improper
connection between them; and the judge charged the
jury, in substance, that if this was the conductor’s
<i>bona fide</i> reason for excluding the woman from the
car, they might take it into consideration on the
question of the liability of the company. The case
was brought here by writ of error at the suit of the
plaintiffs. The cases of Stanley, Nichols, and Singleton
came up on certificates of division of opinion
between the judges below as to the constitutionality
of the first and second sections of the act referred to;
and the case of Ryan, on a writ of error to the judgment
of the Circuit Court for the District of California
sustaining a demurrer to the information.</p>

<p>The Stanley, Ryan, Nichols, and Singleton cases
were submitted together by the solicitor general at
the last term of court, on the 7th day of November,
1882. There were no appearances and no briefs filed
for the defendants.</p>

<p>The Robinson case was submitted on the briefs
at the last term, on the 29th day of March, 1883.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Solicitor General Phillips</i> for the United
States.</p>

<p>After considering some objections in the forms
of proceedings in the different cases, the counsel
reviewed the following decisions of the court upon
the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the
Constitution and on points cognate thereto, viz.:
<cite>The Slaughter-House Cases</cite>, 16 Wall. 36; <cite>Bradwell <span class="antiqua">v.</span>
The State</cite>, 16 Wall. 130; <cite>Bartmeyer <span class="antiqua">v.</span> Iowa</cite>, 18 Wall.

<cite>Railroad Co. <span class="antiqua">v.</span> Brown</cite>, 17 Wall. 445; <cite>Hall <span class="antiqua">v.</span> DeCuir</cite>,

Lewis</cite>, 101 U. S. 22; <cite>Neal <span class="antiqua">v.</span> Delaware</cite>, 103 U. S. 370.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, these cases decide that,</p>

<p>1. The Thirteenth Amendment forbids all sorts
of involuntary personal servitude except penal, as to
all sorts of men, the word servitude taking some
color from the historical fact that the United States
were then engaged in dealing with African slavery,
as well as from the signification of the Fourteenth
and Fifteenth Amendments, which must be construed
as <em>advancing</em> constitutional rights previously existing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The Fourteenth Amendment expresses prohibitions
(and consequently implies corresponding
positive immunities), <em>limiting State action only</em>, including
in such action, however, action by all State
agencies executive, legislative and judicial, of whatever
degree.</p>

<p>3. The Fourteenth Amendment warrants legislation
by Congress punishing violations of the immunities
thereby secured when committed by agents of
States in discharge of ministerial functions.</p>

<p>The right violated by Nichols, which is of the
same class as that violated by Stanley and by Hamilton,
is the right of locomotion, which Blackstone
makes an element of personal liberty. Blackstone’s
Commentaries, Book I, ch. 1.</p>

<p>In violation of this right, Nichols did not act in
an exclusively private capacity, but in one devoted
to public use, and so affected with a public, <i>i. e.</i>, a
State interest. This phrase will be recognized as
taken from the <cite>Elevator Cases</cite> in 94 U. S., already
cited.</p>

<p>Restraint upon the right of locomotion was a
well-known feature of the slavery abolished by the
Thirteenth Amendment. A first requisite of the
right to appropriate the use of another man was to
become the master of his natural power of motion,
and by a mayhem therein of the common law to
require the whole community to be on the alert to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
restrain that power. That this is not exaggeration is
shown by the language of the court in <cite>Eaton <span class="antiqua">v.</span>
Vaughan</cite>, 9 Missouri, 734.</p>

<p>Granting that by <em>involuntary servitude</em>, as prohibited
in the Thirteenth Amendment, is intended
some <em>institution</em>, viz., custom, etc., of that sort, and
not primarily mere scattered trespasses against liberty
committed by private persons, yet, considering what
must be the social tendency in at least large parts of
the country, it is “appropriate legislation” against
such an institution to forbid any action by private
persons which in the light of our history may reasonably
be apprehended to tend, on account of its being
incidental to quasi public occupations, to create an
<em>institution</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore the above act of 1875, in prohibiting
persons from violating the rights of other persons to
the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations
of inns and public conveyances, for any reason turning
merely upon the race or color of the latter, partakers
of the specific character of certain contemporaneous
solemn and effective action by the United
States to which it was a sequel—and is constitutional.</p>

<p><em>Mr. William M. Randolph</em> for Robinson and wife,
plaintiffs in error.</p>

<p>Where the constitution guarantees a right, Congress
is empowered to pass the legislation appropriate
to give effect to that right. <cite>Prigg <span class="antiqua">v.</span> Pennsylvania</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
16 Peters, 539; <cite>Ableman <span class="antiqua">v.</span> Booth</cite>, 21 How. 506;
<cite>United States <span class="antiqua">v.</span> Reese</cite>, 92 U. S. 214.</p>

<p>Whether Mr. Robinson’s rights were created by
the Constitution, or only guaranteed by it, in either
event the act of Congress, so far as it protects them
is within the Constitution. <cite>Pensacola Telegraph Co. <span class="antiqua">v.</span>
Western Union Tel. Co.</cite>, 96 U. S. 1; <cite>The Passenger
Cases</cite>, 7 Howard, 283; <cite>Crandall <span class="antiqua">v.</span> Nevada</cite>, 6 Wall. 35.</p>

<p>In <cite>Munn <span class="antiqua">v.</span> Illinois</cite>, 94 U. S. 113 the following
propositions were affirmed:</p>

<p>“Under the powers inherent in every sovereignty,
a government may regulate the conduct of its citizens
toward each other, and, when necessary for the public
good, the manner in which each shall use his own
property.”</p>

<p>“It has, in the exercise of these powers, been
customary in England, from time immemorial, and in
this country from its first colonization, to regulate
ferries, common carriers, hackmen, bakers, millers,
wharfingers, innkeepers, etc.”</p>

<p>“When the owner of a property devotes it to a
use in which the public has an interest, he in effect
grants to the public an interest in such use, and must,
to the extent of that interest, submit to be controlled
by the public, for the common good, as long as he
maintains the use.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Undoubtedly, if Congress could legislate on the
subject at all, its legislation, by the act of 1st March,
1875, was within the principles thus announced.</p>

<p>The penalty denounced by the statute is incurred
by denying to any citizen “the full enjoyment of any
of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or
privileges” enumerated in the first section, and it is
wholly immaterial whether the citizen whose rights
are denied him belongs to one race or class or another,
or is of one complexion or another. And again, the
penalty follows every denial of the full enjoyment of
any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, or
privileges, except and unless the denial was “<em>for
reasons by law</em> applicable to citizens of every race and
color, and regardless of any previous condition of
servitude.”</p>

<p><em>Mr. William Y. C. Humes</em> and <em>Mr. David Posten</em>
for the Memphis and Charleston Railroad Co., defendants
in error.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Decision of the Court.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Justice Bradley</span> delivered the opinion of
the court. After stating the facts in the above language,
he continued:</p>

<p>It is obvious that the primary and important
question in all the cases is the constitutionality of the
law; for if the law is unconstitutional, none of the
prosecutions can stand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The sections of the law referred to provide as
follows:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sec. 1.</span> That all persons within the jurisdiction
of the United States shall be entitled to the full
and equal enjoyment of the accommodations,
advantages, facilities and privileges of inns, public
conveyances on land or water, theatres and other
places of public amusement; subject only to the
conditions and limitations established by law, and
applicable alike to citizens of every race and color,
regardless of any previous condition of servitude.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sec. 2.</span> That any person who shall violate the
foregoing section by denying to any citizen, except
for reasons by law applicable to citizens of every
race and color, and regardless of any previous condition
of servitude, the full enjoyment of any of the
accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges
in said section enumerated, or by aiding or inciting
such denial, shall for every such offence forfeit and
pay the sum of five hundred dollars to the person
aggrieved thereby, to be recovered in an action of
debt, with full costs; and shall also, for every such
offence, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and,
upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not less than
five hundred nor more than one thousand dollars, or
shall be imprisoned not less than thirty days nor
more than one year: <em>Provided</em>, That all persons
may elect to sue for the penalty aforesaid, or to proceed
under their rights at common law and by State
statutes; and having so elected to proceed in the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
mode or the other, their right to proceed in the other
jurisdiction shall be barred. But this provision shall
not apply to criminal proceedings, either under this
act or the criminal law of any State; <em>And provided
further</em>, That a judgment for the penalty in favor of
the party aggrieved, or a judgment upon an indictment,
shall be a bar to either prosecution respectively.”</p>

<p>Are these sections constitutional? The first
section, which is the principal one, cannot be fairly
understood without attending to the last clause, which
qualifies the preceding part.</p>

<p>The essence of the law is, not to declare broadly
that all persons shall be entitled to the full and equal
enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities
and privileges of inns, public conveyances and
theatres; but that such enjoyment shall not be subject
to any conditions applicable only to citizens of a
particular race or color, or who had been in a previous
condition of servitude. In other words, it is the purpose
of the law to declare that, in the enjoyment of
the accommodations and privileges of inns, public
conveyances, theatres and other places of public
amusement, no distinction shall be made between
citizens of different race or color, or between those
who have, and those who have not, been slaves. Its
effect is to declare, that in all inns, public conveyances
and places of amusement, colored citizens, whether
formerly slaves or not, and citizens of other races,
shall have the same accommodations and privileges
in all inns, public conveyances and places of amusement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
as are enjoyed by white citizens; and <i>vice versa</i>.
The second section makes it a penal offence in any
person to deny to any citizen of any race or color,
regardless of previous servitude, any of the accommodations
or privileges mentioned in the first section.</p>

<p>Has Congress constitutional power to make such
a law? Of course, no one will contend that the
power to pass it was contained in the Constitution
before the adoption of the last three amendments.
The power is sought, first, in the Fourteenth Amendment,
and the views and arguments of distinguished
Senators, advanced whilst the law was under consideration,
claiming authority to pass it by virtue of
that amendment, are the principal arguments adduced
in favor of the power. We have carefully considered
those arguments, as was due to the eminent ability of
those who put them forward, and have felt, in all its
force, the weight of authority which always invests a
law that Congress deems itself competent to pass.
But the responsibility of an independent judgment is
now thrown upon this court; and we are bound to
exercise it according to the best lights we have.</p>

<p>The first section of the Fourteenth Amendment
(which is the one relied on), after declaring who shall
be citizens of the United States, and of the several
States, is prohibitory in its character, and prohibitory
upon the States. It declares that:</p>

<p>“No State shall make or enforce any law which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens
of the United States; nor shall any State deprive
any person of life, liberty or property without due
process of law; nor deny to any person within its
jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”</p>

<p>It is State action of a particular character that
is prohibited. Individual invasion of individual
rights is not the subject-matter of the amendment.
It has a deeper and broader scope. It nullifies and
makes void all State legislation and State action of
every kind which impairs the privileges and immunities
of citizens of the United States, or which injures
them in life, liberty or property without due process
of law, or which denies to any of them the equal
protection of the laws. It not only does this, but
in order that the national will thus declared may
not be a mere <i>brutum fulmen</i>, the last section of the
amendment invests Congress with power to enforce
it by appropriate legislation. To enforce what?
To enforce the prohibition. To adopt appropriate
legislation for correcting the effects of such prohibited
State laws and State acts, and thus to render
them effectually null, void and innocuous. This is
the legislative power conferred upon Congress, and
this is the whole of it. It does not invest Congress
with power to legislate upon subjects which are within
the domain of State legislation; but to provide modes
of relief against State legislation or State action of
the kind referred to. It does not authorize Congress
to create a code of municipal law for the regulation
of private rights; but to provide modes of redress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
against the operation of State laws, and the action
of State officers, executive or judicial, when these are
subversive of the fundamental rights specified in the
amendment. Positive rights and privileges are undoubtedly
secured by the Fourteenth Amendment;
but they are secured by way of prohibition against
State laws and State proceedings affecting those
rights and privileges, and by power given to Congress
to legislate for the purpose of carrying such prohibition
into effect; and such legislation must necessarily
be predicated upon such supposed State laws or State
proceedings, and be directed to the correction of their
operation and effect. A quite full discussion of this
aspect of the amendment may be found in <cite>United
States <span class="antiqua">v.</span> Cruikshank</cite>, 92 U. S. 542; <cite>Virginia <span class="antiqua">v.</span> Rives</cite>,
100 U. S. 313; and <cite>Ex parte Virginia</cite>, 100 U. S. 339.</p>

<p>An apt illustration of this distinction may be
found in some of the provisions of the original Constitution.
Take the subject of contracts, for example.
The Constitution prohibited the States from passing
any law impairing any obligation of contracts. This
did not give to Congress power to provide laws for
the general enforcement of contracts, nor power to
invest the courts of the United States with jurisdiction
over contracts so as to enable parties to sue upon
them in those courts. It did, however, give the power
to provide remedies by which the impairment of contracts
by State legislation might be counteracted and
corrected; and this power was exercised. The
remedy which Congress actually provided was that
contained in the 25th section of the Judiciary Act of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
1789, 1 Stat. 85, giving to the Supreme Court of the
United States jurisdiction by writ of error to review
the final decisions of State courts whenever they
should sustain the validity of a State statute or
authority alleged to be repugnant to the Constitution
or laws of the United States. By this means, if a
State law was passed impairing the obligation of a
contract, and the State tribunals sustained the validity
of the law, the mischief could be corrected in this
court. The legislation of Congress, and the proceedings
provided under it, were corrective in their character.
No attempt was made to draw into the United
States courts the litigation of contracts generally, and
no such attempt would have been sustained. We do
not say that the remedy provided was the only one
that might have been provided in that case. Probably
Congress had power to pass a law giving to the
courts of the United States direct jurisdiction over
contracts alleged to be impaired by a State law; and
under the broad provisions of the act of March 3rd,
1875, ch. 237, 18 Stat. 470, giving to the circuit courts
jurisdiction of all cases arising under the Constitution
and laws of the United States, it is possible that such
jurisdiction now exists. But under that, or any other
law, it must appear as well by allegation, as proof at
the trial, that the Constitution had been violated by
the action of the State legislature. Some obnoxious
State law passed, or that might be passed, is necessary
to be assumed in order to lay the foundation of
any federal remedy in the case, and for the very sufficient
reason, that the constitutional provision is against
<em>State laws</em> impairing the obligation of contracts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>And so in the present case, until some State law
has been passed, or some State action through its
officers or agents has been taken adverse to the rights
of citizens sought to be protected by the Fourteenth
Amendment, no legislation of the United States
under said amendment, nor any proceeding under
such legislation, can be called into activity, for the
prohibitions of the amendment are against State laws
and acts done under State authority. Of course,
legislation may, and should be, provided in advance
to meet the exigency when it arises; but it should
be adapted to the mischief and wrong which the
amendment was intended to provide against, and that
is State laws or State action of some kind adverse to
the rights of the citizen secured by the amendment.
Such legislation cannot properly cover the whole
domain of rights appertaining to life, liberty and
property, defining them and providing for their vindication.
That would be to establish a code of municipal
law regulative of all private rights between man
and man in society. It would be to make Congress
take the place of the State legislatures and to supersede
them. It is absurd to affirm that, because the
rights of life, liberty and property (which include all
civil rights that men have) are by the amendment
sought to be protected against invasion on the part
of the State without due process of law, Congress
may therefore provide due process of law for their
vindication in every case, and that, because the denial
by a State to any person of the equal protection of
the laws is prohibited by the amendment, therefore
Congress may establish laws for their equal protection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
In fine, the legislation which Congress is
authorized to adopt in this behalf is not general legislation
upon the rights of the citizen, but corrective
legislation, that is, such as may be necessary and
proper for counteracting such laws as the States may
adopt or enforce, and which, by the amendment, they
are prohibited from making or enforcing, or such acts
and proceedings as the States may commit or take,
and which, by the amendment, they are prohibited
from committing or taking. It is not necessary for
us to state, if we could, what legislation would be
proper for Congress to adopt. It is sufficient for us
to examine whether the law in question is of that
character.</p>

<p>An inspection of the law shows that it makes no
reference whatever to any supposed or apprehended
violation of the Fourteenth Amendment on the part
of the States. It is not predicated on an such view.
It proceeds <i>ex directo</i> to declare that certain acts committed
by individuals shall be deemed offences, and
shall be prosecuted and punished by proceedings in
the courts of the United States. It does not profess
to be corrective of any constitutional wrong committed
by the States; it does not make its operation
to depend upon any such wrong committed. It
applies equally to cases arising in States which have
the justest laws respecting the personal rights of
citizens, and whose authorities are ever ready to
enforce such laws, as to those which arise in States
that may have violated the prohibition of the amendment.
In other words, it steps into the domain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
local jurisprudence, and lays down rules for the conduct
of individuals in society towards each other, and
imposes sanctions for the enforcement of those rules
without referring in any manner to any supposed
action of the State or its authorities.</p>

<p>If this legislation is appropriate for enforcing the
prohibitions of the amendment, it is difficult to see
where it is to stop. Why may not Congress with
equal show of authority enact a code of laws for the
enforcement and vindication of all rights of life,
liberty and property? If it is supposable that the
States may deprive persons of life, liberty and property
without due process of law (and the amendment
itself does suppose this), why should not Congress
proceed at once to prescribe due process of law
for the protection of every one of these fundamental
rights in every possible case, as well as to prescribe
equal privileges in inns, public conveyances and
theatres? The truth is, that the implication of a
power to legislate in this manner is based upon the
assumption that if the States are forbidden to legislate
or act in a particular way on a particular subject,
and power is conferred upon Congress to enforce the
prohibition, this gives Congress power to legislate
generally upon that subject, and not merely power to
provide modes of redress against such State legislation
or action. The assumption is certainly unsound.
It is repugnant to the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution,
which declares that powers not delegated to
the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively
or to the people.</p>

<p>We have not overlooked the fact that the fourth
section of the act now under consideration has been
held by this court to be constitutional. That section
declares “that no citizen, possessing all other qualifications
which are or may be prescribed by law, shall
be disqualified for service as grand or petit juror in
any court of the United States, or of any State, on
account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude;
and any officer or other person charged with
any duty in the selection or summoning of jurors,
who shall exclude or fail to summon any citizen for
the cause aforesaid, shall, on conviction thereof, be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and be fined not
more than five thousand dollars.” In <cite>Ex parte Virginia</cite>,
100 U. S. 339, it was held that an indictment
against a State officer under this section for excluding
persons of color from the jury list is sustainable.
But a moment’s attention to its terms will show that
the section is entirely corrective in its character.
Disqualifications for service on juries are only created
by the law, and the first part of the section is aimed
at certain disqualifying laws, namely, those which
make mere race or color a disqualification, and the
second clause is directed against those who, assuming
to use the authority of the State government, carry
into effect such a rule of disqualification. In the
Virginia case, the State through its officer enforced a
rule of disqualification which the law was intended to
abrogate and counteract. Whether the statute book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of the State actually laid down any such rule of disqualification
or not, the State through its officer enforced
such a rule; and it is against such State action
through its officers and agents that the last clause of
the section is directed. This aspect of the law was
deemed sufficient to divest it of any unconstitutional
character, and makes it differ widely from the first
and second sections of the same act which we are
now considering.</p>

<p>These sections, in the objectionable features before
referred to, are different also from the law ordinarily
called the “Civil Rights Bill,” originally passed
April 9, 1866, 14 Stat. 27, ch. 31, and re-enacted with
some modifications in sections 16, 17, 18, of the Enforcement
Act passed May 31st, 1870, 16 Stat. 140,
ch. 114. That law, as re-enacted, after declaring that
all persons within the jurisdiction of the United
States shall have the same right in every State and
Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be
parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit
of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons
and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and
shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties,
taxes, licenses and exactions of every kind, and none
other, any law, statute, ordinance, regulation or custom
to the contrary notwithstanding, proceeds to
enact that any person who, under color of any law,
statute, ordinance, regulation or custom, shall subject,
or cause to be subjected, any inhabitant of any State
or Territory to the deprivation of any rights secured
or protected by the preceding section above quoted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
or to different punishment, pains or penalties on
account of such person being an alien, or by reason
of his color or race, than is prescribed for the punishment
of citizens, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,
and subject to fine and imprisonment as
specified in the act. This law is clearly corrective in
its character, intended to counteract and furnish redress
against State laws and proceedings and customs
having the force of law which sanction the wrongful
acts specified. In the Revised Statutes, it is true,
a very important clause, to wit, the words “any law,
statute, ordinance, regulation or custom to the contrary
notwithstanding,” which gave the declaratory
section its point and effect, are omitted; but the
penal part, by which the declaration is enforced, and
which is really the effective part of the law, retains
the reference to state laws by making the penalty
apply only to those who should subject parties to a
deprivation of their rights under color of any statute,
ordinance, custom, etc., of any State or Territory, thus
preserving the corrective character of the legislation.
Rev. St., §§ 1977, 1978, 1979, 5510. The Civil Rights
Bill here referred to is analogous in its character to
what a law would have been under the original Constitution,
declaring that the validity of contracts
should not be impaired, and that if any person bound
by a contract should refuse to comply with it under
color or pretence that it had been rendered void or
invalid by a State law, he should be liable to an
action upon it in the courts of the United States,
with the addition of a penalty for setting up such an
unjust and unconstitutional defence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>In this connection it is proper to state that civil
rights, such as are guaranteed by the Constitution
against State aggression, cannot be impaired by the
wrongful acts of individuals unsupported by State
authority in the shape of laws, customs, or judicial or
executive proceedings. The wrongful act of an individual,
unsupported by any such authority, is simply
a private wrong, or a crime of that individual—an
invasion of the rights of the injured party, it is
true, whether they affect his person, his property or
his reputation; but if not sanctioned in some way by
the State, or not done under State authority, his
rights remain in full force, and may presumably be
vindicated by resort to the laws of the State for
redress. An individual cannot deprive a man of his
right to vote, to hold property, to buy and sell, to sue
in the courts, or to be a witness or juror; he may,
by force or fraud, interfere with the enjoyment of the
right in a particular case; he may commit an assault
against the person, or commit murder, or use ruffian
violence at the polls, or slander the good name of a
fellow-citizen; but unless protected in these wrongful
acts by some shield of State law or State authority,
he cannot destroy or injure the right; he will only
render himself amenable to satisfaction or punishment,
and amenable therefor to the laws of the State
where the wrongful acts are committed. Hence in
all of those cases where the Constitution seeks to
protect the rights of the citizen against discriminative
and unjust laws of the State by prohibiting such
laws, it is not individual offences, but abrogation and
denial of rights which it denounces, and for which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
clothes the Congress with power to provide a remedy.
This abrogation and denial of rights, for which the
States alone were or could be responsible, was the
great seminal and fundamental wrong which was intended
to be remedied. And the remedy to be provided
must necessarily be predicated upon that wrong.
It must assume that in the cases provided for the
evil or wrong actually committed rests upon some
State law or State authority for its excuse and perpetration.</p>

<p>Of course these remarks do not apply to those
cases in which Congress is clothed with direct and
plenary powers of legislation over the whole subject,
accompanied with an express or implied denial of
such power to the States, as in the regulation of commerce
with foreign nations, among the several States,
and with the Indian tribes, the coining of money, the
establishment of post offices and post roads, the declaring
of war, etc. In these cases Congress has
power to pass laws for regulating the subjects specified
in every detail, and the conduct and transactions
of individuals in respect thereof. But where a subject
is not submitted to the general legislative power
of Congress, but is only submitted thereto for the
purpose of rendering effective some prohibition
against particular State legislation or State action in
reference to that subject, the power given is limited
by its object, and any legislation by Congress in the
matter must necessarily be corrective in its character,
adapted to counteract and redress the operation of such
prohibited State laws or proceedings of State officers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>If the principles of interpretation which we have
laid down are correct, as we deem them to be (and
they are in accord with the principles laid down in
the cases before referred to, as well as in the recent
case of <cite>United States <span class="antiqua">v.</span> Harris</cite>, 106 U. S. 629), it is
clear that the law in question cannot be sustained by
any grant of legislative power made to Congress by
the Fourteenth Amendment. That amendment prohibits
the States from denying to any person the
equal protection of the laws, and declares that Congress
shall have power to enforce, by appropriate
legislation, the provisions of the amendment. The
law in question, without any reference to adverse State
legislation on the subject, declares that all persons
shall be entitled to equal accommodations and privileges
of inns, public conveyances and places of public
amusement, and imposes a penalty upon any individual
who shall deny to any citizen such equal
accommodations and privileges. This is not corrective
legislation; it is primary and direct; it takes
immediate and absolute possession of the subject of
the right of admission to inns, public conveyances
and places of amusement; it supersedes and displaces
State legislation on the same subject, or only allows
it permissive force; it ignores such legislation, and
assumes that the matter is one that belongs to the
domain of national regulation. Whether it would not
have been a more effective protection of the rights of
citizens to have clothed Congress with plenary power
over the whole subject is not now the question. What
we have to decide is, whether such plenary power has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
been conferred upon Congress by the Fourteenth
Amendment; and in our judgment it has not.</p>

<p>We have discussed the question presented by
the law on the assumption that a right to enjoy equal
accommodations and privileges in all inns, public
conveyances and places of public amusements, is one
of the essential rights of the citizen which no State
can abridge or interfere with. Whether it is such a
right or not, is a different question which, in the view
we have taken of the validity of the law on the ground
already stated, it is not necessary to examine.</p>

<p>We have also discussed the validity of the law in
reference to cases arising in the States only; and not
in reference to cases arising in the Territories or the
District of Columbia, which are subject to the plenary
legislation of Congress in every branch of municipal
regulation. Whether the law would be a valid one
as applied to the Territories and the District is not a
question for consideration in the cases before us; they
all being cases arising within the limits of States.
And whether Congress, in the exercise of its power
to regulate commerce amongst the several States,
might or might not pass a law regulating rights in
public conveyances passing from one State to another,
is also a question which is not now before us, as the
sections in question are not conceived in any such
view.</p>

<p>But the power of Congress to adopt direct and
primary, as distinguished from corrective legislation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
on the subject in hand, is sought, in the second place,
from the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolishes
slavery. This amendment declares “that neither
slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment
for crime, whereof the party shall have been
duly convicted, shall exist within the United States,
or any place subject to their jurisdiction;” and it
gives Congress power to enforce the amendment by
appropriate legislation.</p>

<p>This amendment, as well as the Fourteenth, is
undoubtedly self-executing without any ancillary
legislation, so far as its terms are applicable to any
existing state of circumstances. By its own unaided
force and effect it abolished slavery, and established
universal freedom. Still, legislation may be necessary
and proper to meet all the various cases and circumstances
to be affected by it, and to prescribe proper
modes of redress for its violation in letter or
spirit. And such legislation may be primary and
direct in its character; for the amendment is not a
mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding
slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery
or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part
of the United States.</p>

<p>It is true that slavery cannot exist without law,
any more than property in land and goods can exist
without law: and, therefore, the Thirteenth Amendment
may be regarded as nullifying all State laws
which establish or uphold slavery. But it has a reflex
character also, establishing and decreeing universal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
civil and political freedom throughout the
United States; and it is assumed that the power
vested in Congress to enforce the article by appropriate
legislation, clothes Congress with power to pass
all laws necessary and proper for abolishing all
badges and incidents of slavery in the United States;
and upon this assumption it is claimed that this is
sufficient authority for declaring by law that all persons
shall have equal accommodations and privileges
in all inns, public conveyances and places of amusement;
the argument being that the denial of such
equal accommodations and privileges is, in itself, a
subjection to a species of servitude within the meaning
of the amendment. Conceding the major proposition
to be true, that Congress has a right to enact
all necessary and proper laws for the obliteration and
prevention of slavery with all its badges and incidents,
is the minor proposition also true, that the
denial to any person of admission to the accommodations
and privileges of an inn, a public conveyance
or a theatre does subject that person to any form of
servitude, or tend to fasten upon him any badge of
slavery? If it does not, then power to pass the law
is not found in the Thirteenth Amendment.</p>

<p>In a very able and learned presentation of the
cognate question, as to the extent of the rights, privileges
and immunities of citizens which cannot rightfully
be abridged by State laws under the Fourteenth
Amendment, made in a former case, a long list of
burdens and disabilities of a servile character incident
to feudal vassalage in France, and which were abolished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
by the decrees of the National Assembly, was
presented for the purpose of showing that all inequalities
and observances exacted by one man from
another were servitudes, or badges of slavery, which
a great nation, in its effort to establish universal
liberty, made haste to wipe out and destroy. But
these were servitudes imposed by the old law, or by
long custom, which had the force of law, and exacted
by one man from another without the latter’s consent.
Should any such servitudes be imposed by a State
law, there can be no doubt that the law would be repugnant
to the Fourteenth, no less than to the Thirteenth
Amendment; nor any greater doubt that Congress
has adequate power to forbid any such servitude
from being exacted.</p>

<p>But is there any similarity between such servitudes
and a denial by the owner of an inn, a public
conveyance or a theatre, of its accommodations and
privileges to an individual, even though the denial be
founded on the race or color of that individual?
Where does any slavery or servitude, or badge of
either, arise from such an act of denial? Whether
it might not be a denial of a right which, if sanctioned
by the State law, would be obnoxious to the prohibitions
of the Fourteenth Amendment is another question.
But what has it to do with the question of
slavery?</p>

<p>It may be that by the Black Code (as it was
called), in the times when slavery prevailed, the proprietors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of inns and public conveyances were forbidden
to receive persons of the African race, because
it might assist slaves to escape from the control of
their masters. This was merely a means of preventing
such escapes, and was no part of the servitude
itself. A law of that kind could not have any such
object now, however justly it might be deemed an
invasion of the party’s legal right as a citizen and
amenable to the prohibitions of the Fourteenth
Amendment.</p>

<p>The long existence of African slavery in this
country gave us very distinct notions of what it was,
and what were its necessary incidents. Compulsory
service of the slave for the benefit of the master,
restraint of his movements except by his master’s
will, disability to hold property, to make contracts,
to have a standing in court, to be a witness against a
white person, and such like burdens and incapacities
were the inseparable incidents of the institution.
Severer punishments for crimes were imposed on the
slave than on free persons guilty of the same offences
Congress, as we have seen, by the Civil Rights Bill
of 1866, passed in view of the Thirteenth Amendment,
before the Fourteenth was adopted, undertook
to wipe out these burdens and disabilities, the necessary
incidents of slavery, constituting its substance
and visible form; and to secure to all citizens of
every race and color, without regard to previous servitude,
those fundamental rights which are the essence
of civil freedom, namely, the same right to make and
enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and to inherit, purchase, lease, sell and convey property,
as is enjoyed by white citizens. Whether this
legislation was fully authorized by the Thirteenth
Amendment alone without the support which it afterward
received from the Fourteenth Amendment, after
the adoption of which it was re-enacted with some
additions, it is not necessary to enquire. It is referred
to for the purpose of showing that at that time (in
1866) Congress did not assume, under the authority
given by the Thirteenth Amendment, to adjust what
may be called the social rights of men and races in
the community, but only to declare and vindicate
those fundamental rights which appertain to the
essence of citizenship, and the enjoyment or deprivation
of which constitutes the essential distinction between
freedom and slavery.</p>

<p>We must not forget that the province and scope
of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments are
different; the former simply abolished slavery; the
latter prohibited the States from abridging the privileges
or immunities of citizens of the United States;
from depriving them of life, liberty or property without
due process of law, and from denying to any the
equal protection of the laws. The amendments are
different and the powers of Congress under them are
different. What Congress has power to do under
one, it may not have power to do under the other.
Under the Thirteenth Amendment, it has only to do
with slavery and its incidents. Under the Fourteenth
Amendment, it has power to counteract and render
nugatory all State laws and proceedings which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the effect to abridge any of the privileges or immunities
of citizens of the United States, or to deprive
them of life, liberty or property without due process
of law, or to deny to any of them the equal protection
of the laws. Under the Thirteenth Amendment,
the legislation, so far as necessary or proper to eradicate
all forms and incidents of slavery and involuntary
servitude, may be direct and primary, operating
upon the acts of individuals, whether sanctioned by
State legislation or not; under the Fourteenth, as we
have already shown, it must necessarily be, and can
only be, corrective in its character, addressed to
counteract and afford relief against State regulations
or proceedings.</p>

<p>The only question under the present head, therefore,
is whether the refusal to any persons of the
accommodations of an inn, or a public conveyance,
or a place of public amusement, by an individual,
and without any sanction or support from the State
law regulation, does inflict upon such persons any
manner of servitude, or form of slavery, as those
terms are understood in this country? Many wrongs
may be obnoxious to the prohibitions of the Fourteenth
Amendment which are not, in any just sense,
incidents or elements of slavery. Such, for example,
would be the taking of private property without due
process of law; or allowing persons who have committed
certain crimes (horse stealing for example) to
be seized and hung by the <i>posse comitatus</i> without
regular trial; or denying to any person, or class of
persons, the right to pursue any peaceful avocations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
allowed to others. What is called class legislation
would belong to this category, and would be obnoxious
to the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment,
but would not necessarily be so to the Thirteenth,
when not involving the idea of any subjection
of one man to another. The Thirteenth Amendment
has respect not to distinctions of race, or class, or
color, but to slavery. The Fourteenth Amendment
extends its protection to races and classes, and prohibits
any State legislation which has the effect of
denying to any race or class, or to any individual, the
equal protection of the laws.</p>

<p>Now, conceding, for the sake of the argument,
that the admission to an inn, a public conveyance or
a place of public amusement, on equal terms with all
other citizens, is the right of every man and all
classes of men, is it any more than one of those
rights which the States by the Fourteenth Amendment
are forbidden to deny to any person? And is
the Constitution violated until the denial of the right
has some State sanction or authority? Can the act
of a mere individual, the owner of the inn, the public
conveyance or place of amusement, refusing the accommodation,
be justly regarded as imposing any
badge of slavery or servitude upon the applicant, or
only as inflicting an ordinary civil injury, properly,
cognizable by the laws of the State, and presumably
subject to redress by those laws until the contrary
appears?</p>

<p>After giving to these questions all the consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
which their importance demands, we are forced
to the conclusion that such an act of refusal has nothing
to do with slavery or involuntary servitude, and
that if it is violative of any right of the party, his
redress is to be sought under the laws of the State;
or if those laws are adverse to his rights and do not
protect him, his remedy will be found in the corrective
legislation which Congress has adopted, or may adopt
for counteracting the effect of State laws, or State
action prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment. It
would be running the slavery argument into the
ground to make it apply to every act of discrimination
which a person may see fit to make as to the guests
he will entertain, or as to the people he will take into
his coach or cab or car, or admit to his concert or
theatre, or deal with in other matters of intercourse
or business. Innkeepers and public carriers, by the
laws of all the States so far as we are aware, are
bound, to the extent of their facilities, to furnish proper
accommodation to all unobjectionable persons
who in good faith apply for them. If the laws themselves
make any unjust discrimination, amenable to
the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress
has full power to afford a remedy under that
amendment and in accordance with it.</p>

<p>When a man has emerged from slavery, and by
the aid of beneficent legislation has shaken off the
inseparable concomitants of that state, there must be
some stage in the progress of his elevation when he
takes the rank of a mere citizen, and ceases to be the
special favorite of the laws, and when his rights as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
citizen, or a man, are to be protected in the ordinary
modes by which other men’s rights are protected.
There were thousands of free colored people in this
country before the abolition of slavery, enjoying all
the essential rights of life, liberty and property the
same as white citizens; yet no one, at that time,
thought that it was any invasion of his personal status
as a freeman because he was not admitted to all the
privileges enjoyed by white citizens, or because he
was subjected to discriminations in the enjoyment of
accommodations in inns, public conveyances and
places of amusement. Mere discriminations on
account of race or color were not regarded as badges
of slavery. If, since that time, the enjoyment of
equal rights in all these respects has become established
by constitutional enactment, it is not by force
of the Thirteenth Amendment (which merely abolishes
slavery), but by force of the Thirteenth and
Fifteenth Amendments.</p>

<p>On the whole we are of opinion, that no countenance
of authority for the passage of the law in question
can be found in either the Thirteenth or Fourteenth
Amendments of the Constitution; and no
other ground of authority for its passage being suggested,
it must necessarily be declared void, at least
so far as its operation in the several States is concerned.</p>

<p>This conclusion disposes of the cases now under
consideration. In the cases of the <cite>United States <span class="antiqua">v.</span>
Michael Ryan</cite>, and of <cite>Richard A. Robinson and wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
<span class="antiqua">v.</span> The Memphis and Charleston Railroad Company</cite>,
the judgment must be affirmed. In the other cases,
the answer to be given will be that the first and
second sections of the act of Congress of March 1st,
1875, entitled “An Act to protect all citizens in their
civil and legal rights,” are unconstitutional and void,
and that judgment should be rendered upon the
several indictments in those cases accordingly,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dissenting Opinion.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Justice Harlan</span> dissenting.</p>

<p>The opinion in these cases proceeds, it seems to
me, upon grounds entirely too narrow and artificial.
I cannot resist the conclusion that the substance and
spirit of the recent amendments of the Constitution
have been sacrificed by a subtle and ingenius verbal
criticism. “It is not the words of the law, but the
internal sense of it, that makes the law: the letter of
the law is the body; the sense and reason of the law
is the soul.” Constitutional provisions, adopted in
the interest of liberty, and for the purpose of securing,
through national legislation, if need be, rights inhering
in a state of freedom, and belonging to American
citizenship, have been so construed as to defeat
the ends the people desired to accomplish, which they
attempted to accomplish, and which they supposed
they had accomplished by changes in their fundamental
law. By this I do not mean that the determination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of these cases should have been materially
controlled by considerations of mere expediency or
policy. I mean only in this form, to express an
earnest conviction that the court has departed from
the familiar rule requiring, in the interpretation of
constitutional provisions, that full effect be given to
the intent with which they were adopted.</p>

<p>The purpose of the first section of the Act of
Congress of March 1, 1875, was to prevent <em>race</em> discrimination
in respect of the accommodations and
facilities of inns, public conveyances and places of
public amusement. It does not assume to define the
general conditions and limitations under which inns,
public conveyances and places of public amusement
may be conducted but only declares that such conditions
and limitations, whatever they may be, shall
not be applied so as to work a discrimination solely
because of race, color or previous condition of servitude.
The second section provides a penalty against
any one denying, or aiding or inciting the denial, to
any citizen, of that equality of right given by the first
section, except for reasons by law applicable to citizens
of every race or color and regardless of any
previous condition of servitude.</p>

<p>There seems to be no substantial difference between
my brethren and myself as to the purpose of
Congress; for, they say that the essence of the law
is, not to declare broadly that all persons shall be
entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations,
advantages, facilities and privileges of inns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
public conveyances and theatres; but that such enjoyment
shall not be subject to conditions applicable
only to citizens of a particular race or color, or who
had been in a previous condition of servitude. The
effect of the statute, the court says, is, that colored
citizens, whether formerly slaves or not, and citizens
of other races, shall have the same accommodations
and privileges in all inns, public conveyances and
places of amusement as are enjoyed by white persons;
and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>The court adjudges, I think erroneously, that
Congress is without power, under either the Thirteenth
or Fourteenth Amendments, to establish such regulations,
and that the first and second sections of the
statute are, in all their parts, unconstitutional and
void.</p>

<p>Whether the legislative department of the government
has transcended the limits of its constitutional
powers, “is at all times,” said the court in
<cite>Fletcher <span class="antiqua">v.</span> Peck</cite>, 6 Cr. 128, “a question of much delicacy,
which ought seldom, if ever, to be decided in
the affirmative, in a doubtful case.... The opposition
between the Constitution and the law should be
such that the judge feels a clear and strong conviction
of their incompatibility with each other.” More recently
in <cite>Sinking Fund Cases</cite>, 99 U. S., 718, we said:
“It is our duty when required in the regular course of
judicial proceedings, to declare an Act of Congress
void if not within the legislative power of the United
States; but this declaration should never be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
except in a clear case. Every possible presumption
is in favor of the validity of a statute, and this continues
until the contrary is shown beyond a rational
doubt. One branch of the government cannot encroach
on the domain of another without danger.
The safety of our institutions depends in no small
degree on a strict observance of this salutary rule.”</p>

<p>Before considering the language and scope of
these amendments, it will be proper to recall the relations
subsisting, prior to their adoption, between the
national government and the institution of slavery,
as indicated by the provisions of the Constitution,
the legislation of Congress, and the decisions of this
court. In this mode we may obtain keys with which
to open the mind of the people, and discover the
thought intended to be expressed.</p>

<p>In section 2 of article IV. of the Constitution it
was provided that “no person held to service or labor
in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into
another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation
therein, be discharged from such service or labor,
but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to
whom such service or labor may be due.” Under
authority of this clause Congress passed the Fugitive
Slave Law of 1793, establishing a mode for the recovery
of fugitive slaves, and prescribing a penalty
against any person who should knowingly and willingly
obstruct or hinder the master, his agent, or
attorney, in seizing, and recovering the fugitive, or
who should rescue the fugitive from him, or who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
should harbor or conceal the slave after notice that
he was a fugitive.</p>

<p>In <cite>Prigg <span class="antiqua">v.</span> Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</cite>, 16
Pet. 539, this court had occasion to define the powers
and duties of Congress in reference to fugitives from
labor. Speaking by <span class="smcap">Mr. Justice Story</span>, it laid
down these propositions:</p>

<p>That a clause of the Constitution conferring a right
should not be so construed as to make it shadowy, or
unsubstantial, or leave the citizen without a remedial
power adequate for its protection, when another construction
equally accordant with the words and the
sense in which they were used, would enforce and
protect the right granted:</p>

<p>That Congress is not restricted to legislation for
the execution of its expressly granted powers; but
for the protection of rights guaranteed by the Constitution,
may employ such means, not prohibited, as
are necessary and proper, or such as are appropriate,
to attain the ends proposed:</p>

<p>That the Constitution recognized the master’s
right of property in his fugitive slave, and, as incidental
thereto, the right of seizing and recovering
him, regardless of any State law, or regulation, or
local custom whatsoever; and,</p>

<p>That the right of the master to have his slave,
thus escaping, delivered up on claim, being guaranteed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
by the Constitution, the fair implication was that
the national government was clothed with appropriate
authority and functions to enforce it.</p>

<p>The court said: “The fundamental principle,
applicable to all cases of this sort, would seem to be
that when the end is required the means are given,
and when the duty is enjoined the ability to perform
it is contemplated to exist on the part of the functionary
to whom it is entrusted.” Again: “It would
be a strange anomaly and forced construction to suppose
that the national government meant to rely for
the due fulfillment of its own proper duties, and the
rights which it intended to secure, upon state legislation,
and not upon that of the Union. <i>A fortiori</i>, it
would be more objectionable to suppose that a power
which was to be the same throughout the Union,
should be confided to State sovereignty which could
not rightfully act beyond its own territorial limits.”</p>

<p>The act of 1793 was, upon these grounds, adjudged
to be a constitutional exercise of the powers
of Congress.</p>

<p>It is to be observed from the report of Prigg’s
case that Pennsylvania, by her attorney-general,
pressed the argument that the obligation to surrender
fugitive slaves was on the States and for the States,
subject to the restriction that they should not pass
laws or establish regulations liberating such fugitives;
that the Constitution did not take from the States
the right to determine the status of all persons within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
their respective jurisdictions; that it was for the State
in which the alleged fugitive was found to determine,
through her courts or in such modes as she prescribed,
whether the person arrested was, in fact, a freeman
or a fugitive slave; that the sole power of the general
government in the premises was, by judicial instrumentality,
to restrain and correct, not to forbid and
prevent in the absence of hostile State action; and
that for the general government to assume primary
authority to legislate on the subject of fugitive slaves,
to the exclusion of the States, would be a dangerous
encroachment on State sovereignty. But to such
suggestions this court turned a deaf ear, and adjudged
that primary legislation by Congress to enforce the
master’s right was authorized by the Constitution.</p>

<p>We next come to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850,
the constitutionality of which rested, as did that of
1793, solely upon the implied power of Congress to
enforce the master’s rights. The provisions of that
act were far in advance of previous legislation. They
placed at the disposal of the master seeking to
recover his fugitive slave, substantially the whole
power of the nation. It invested commissioners,
appointed under the act, with power to summon the
<i>posse comitatus</i> for the enforcement of its provisions,
and commanded all good citizens to assist in its
prompt and efficient execution whenever their services
were required as part of the <i>posse comitatus</i>. Without
going into the details of that act, it is sufficient
to say that Congress omitted from it nothing which
the utmost ingenuity could suggest as essential to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
successful enforcement of the master’s claim to recover
his fugitive slave. And this court, in <cite>Ableman <span class="antiqua">v.</span>
Booth</cite>, 21 How. 506, adjudged it to be “in all of
its provisions fully authorized by the Constitution of
the United States.”</p>

<p>The only other case, prior to the adoption of the
recent amendments, to which reference will be made,
is that of <cite>Dred Scott <span class="antiqua">v.</span> Sanford</cite>, 19 How, 399. That
case was instituted in a circuit court of the United
States by Dred Scott, claiming to be a citizen of
Missouri, the defendant being a citizen of another
State. Its object was to assert the title of himself
and family to freedom. The defendant pleaded in
abatement that Scott—being of African descent,
whose ancestors, of pure African blood, were brought
into this country and sold as slaves—was not a <em>citizen</em>.
The only matter in issue, said the court, was whether
the descendants of slaves thus imported and sold,
when they should be emancipated, or who were born
of parents who had become free before their birth,
are citizens of a State in the sense in which the word
“citizen” is used in the Constitution of the United
States.</p>

<p>In determining that question the court instituted
an inquiry as to who were citizens of the several
States at the adoption of the Constitution, and who,
at that time, were recognized as the people whose
rights and liberties had been violated by the British
Government. The result was a declaration, by this
court, speaking by Chief Justice Taney, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
legislation and histories of the times, and the language
used in the Declaration of Independence,
showed “that neither the class of persons who had
been imported as slaves, nor their descendants, whether
they had become free or not, were then acknowledged
as a part of the people, nor intended to be
included in the general words used in that instrument;”
that “they had for more than a century before
been regarded as beings of an inferior race, and
altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either
in social or political relations, and so far inferior that
they had no rights which the white man was bound
to respect, and that the negro might justly and lawfully
be reduced to slavery for his benefit that he
was “bought and sold, and treated as an ordinary
article of merchandise and traffic, whenever a profit
could be made by it;” and, that “this opinion was
at that time fixed and universal in the civilized portion
of the white race. It was regarded as an axiom
in morals as well as in politics, which no one thought
of disputing, or supposed to be open to dispute; and
men in every grade and position in society daily and
habitually acted upon it in their private pursuits, as
well as in matters of public concern, without for a
moment doubting the correctness of this opinion.”</p>

<p>The judgment of the court was that the words
“people of the United States” and “citizens” meant
the same thing, both describing “the political body
who, according to our republican institutions, form
the sovereignty and hold the power and conduct the
government through their representatives;” that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
“they are what we familiarly call the ‘sovereign people,’
and ‘every citizen is one of this people and a
constituent member of this sovereignty;’” but, that
the class of persons described in the plea in abatement
did not compose a portion of this people, were
not “included and were not intended to be included
under the word ‘citizens’ in the Constitution;’” that,
therefore, they could “claim none of the rights and
privileges which that instrument provides for and
secures to citizens of the United States;” that, “on
the contrary, they were at that time considered as a
subordinate and inferior class of beings, who had
been subjugated by the dominant race, and, whether
emancipated or not, yet remained subject to their
authority, and had no rights or privileges but such as
those who held the power and the government might
choose to grant them.”</p>

<p>Such were the relations which formerly existed
between the government, whether national or State,
and the descendants, whether free or in bondage, of
those of African blood, who had been imported into
this country and sold as slaves.</p>

<p>The first section of the Thirteenth Amendment
provides that “neither slavery nor involuntary servitude,
except as a punishment for crime, whereof the
party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist
within the United States, or any place subject to their
jurisdiction.” Its second section declares that “Congress
shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
legislation.” This amendment was followed
by the Civil Rights Act of April 9, 1866,
which, among other things, provided that “all persons
born in the United States, and not subject to any
foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, and hereby
declared to be citizens of the United States.” 14
Stat. 27. The power of Congress, in this mode, to
elevate the enfranchised race to national citizenship,
was maintained by the supporters of the act of 1886
to be as full and complete as its power, by general
statute, to make the children, being of full age, of
persons naturalized in this country, citizens of the
United States without going through the process of
naturalization. The act of 1866, in this respect was
also likened to that of 1843, in which Congress declared
“that the Stockbridge tribe of Indians, and
each and every one of them, shall be deemed to be
and are hereby declared to be, citizens of the United
States to all intents and purposes, and shall be entitled
to all the rights, privileges, and immunities of
such citizens, and shall in all respects be subject to
the laws of the United States.” If the act of 1866
was valid in conferring national citizenship upon all
embraced by its terms, then the colored race, enfranchised
by the Thirteenth Amendment, became citizens
of the United States prior to the adoption of
the Fourteenth Amendment. But, in the view which
I take of the present case, it is not necessary to examine
this question.</p>

<p>The terms of the Thirteenth Amendment are
absolute and universal. They embrace every race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
which then was, or might thereafter be, within the
United States. No race, as such, can be excluded
from the benefits or rights thereby conferred. Yet,
it is historically true that that amendment was suggested
by the condition, in this country, of that race
which had been declared, by this court, to have had—according
to the opinion entertained by the most
civilized portion of the white race, at the time of the
adoption of the Constitution—“no rights which the
white man was bound to respect,” none of the privileges
or immunities secured by that instrument to
citizens of the United States. It had reference, in a
peculiar sense, to a people which (although the larger
part of them were in slavery) had been invited by an
act of Congress to aid in saving from overthrow a
government which theretofore, by all of its departments,
had treated them as an inferior race, with no
legal rights or privileges, except such as the white race
might choose to grant them.</p>

<p>These are the circumstances under which the
Thirteenth Amendment was proposed for adoption.
They are now recalled only that we may better understand
what was in the minds of the people when that
amendment was considered, and what were the mischiefs
to be remedied and the grievances to be redressed
by its adoption.</p>

<p>We have seen that the power of Congress, by
legislation, to enforce the master’s right to have his
slave delivered up on claim was <em>implied</em> from the
recognition of that right in the national Constitution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
But the power conferred by the Thirteenth Amendment
does not rest upon implication or inference.
Those who framed it were ignorant of the discussion,
covering many years of our country’s history, as to
the constitutional power of Congress to enact the
Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and 1850. When, therefore,
it was determined, by a change in the fundamental
law, to uproot the institution of slavery wherever
it existed in the land, and to establish universal
freedom, there was a fixed purpose to place the
authority of Congress in the premise; beyond the
possibility of a doubt. Therefore, <i>ex industria</i>, power
to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment, by appropriate
legislation, was expressly granted. Legislation for
that purpose, my brethren concede, may be direct
and primary. But to what specific ends may it be
directed? This court has uniformly held that the
national government has the power, whether expressly
given or not, to secure and protect rights conferred
or granted by the Constitution. <cite>United States <span class="antiqua">v.</span>
Reese</cite>, 92 U. S. 214; <cite>Strauder <span class="antiqua">v.</span> West Virginia</cite>, 100
U. S. 303. That doctrine ought not now to be abandoned
when the inquiry is not as to an implied power
to protect the master’s rights, but what may Congress,
under powers expressly granted, do for the protection
of freedom and the rights necessarily inhering in a
state of freedom.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth Amendment, it is conceded, did
something more than to prohibit slavery as an <em>institution</em>,
resting upon distinction of race, and upheld
by positive law. My brethren admit that it established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and decreed universal <em>civil freedom</em> throughout
the United States. But did the freedom thus established
involve nothing more than exemption from
actual slavery? Was nothing more intended than to
forbid one man from owning another as property?
Was it the purpose of the nation simply to destroy
the institution, and then remit the race, theretofore
held in bondage, to the several States for such protection,
in their civil rights, necessarily growing out
of freedom, as those states in their discretion, might
choose to provide? Were the States against whose
protest the institution was destroyed, to be left free,
as far as national interference was concerned, to make
or allow discriminations against that race, as such, in
the enjoyment of those fundamental rights which by
universal concession, inhere in a state of freedom?
Had the Thirteenth Amendment stopped with the
sweeping declaration, in its first section, against the
existence of slavery and involuntary servitude, except
for crime, Congress would have had the power, by
implication, according to the doctrine of <cite>Prigg <span class="antiqua">v.</span>
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</cite>, repeated in <cite>Strauder <span class="antiqua">v.</span>
West Virginia</cite>, to protect the freedom established,
and consequently, to secure the enjoyment of such
civil rights as were fundamental in freedom. That it
can exert its authority to that extent is made clear,
and was intended to be made clear, by the express
grant of power contained in the second section of the
Amendment.</p>

<p>That there are burdens and disabilities which
constitute badges of slavery and servitude, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the power to enforce by appropriate legislation the
Thirteenth Amendment may be exerted by legislation
of a direct and primary character, for the eradication,
not simply of the institution, but of its badges
and incidents, are propositions which ought to be
deemed indisputable. They lie at the foundation of
the Civil Rights Act of 1866. Whether that act was
authorized by the Thirteenth Amendment alone,
without the support which it subsequently received
from the Fourteenth Amendment, after the adoption
of which it was re-enacted with some additions, my
brethren do not consider it necessary, to inquire. But
I submit, with all respect to them, that its constitutionality
is conclusively shown by their opinion. They
admit, as I have said, that the Thirteenth Amendment
established freedom; that there are burdens
and disabilities, the necessary incidents of slavery,
which constitute its substance and visible form; that
Congress, by the act of 1866, passed in view of the
Thirteenth Amendment, before the Fourteenth was
adopted, undertook to remove certain burdens and
disabilities, the necessary incidents of slavery, and to
secure to all citizens of every race and color, and without
regard to previous servitude, those fundamental
rights which are the essence of civil freedom, namely,
the same right to make and enforce contracts, to sue,
be parties, give evidence, and to inherit, purchase,
lease, sell and convey property as is enjoyed by white
citizens; that under the Thirteenth Amendment, Congress
has to do with slavery and its incidents; and
that legislation, so far as necessary or proper to eradicate
all forms and incidents of slavery and involuntary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
servitude, may be direct and primary, operating
upon the acts of individuals whether sanctioned by
State legislation or not. These propositions being
conceded, it is impossible, as it seems to me, to question
the constitutional validity of the Civil Rights Act
of 1866. I do not contend that the Thirteenth
Amendment vests Congress with authority, by legislation,
to define and regulate the entire body of the
civil rights which citizens enjoy, or may enjoy, in the
several States. But I hold that since slavery, as the
court has repeatedly declared, <cite>Slaughter-house Cases</cite>.
16 Wall. 36; <cite>Strauder <span class="antiqua">v.</span> West Virginia</cite>, 100 U. S.
303, was the moving or principal cause of the adoption
of that amendment, and since that institution
rested wholly upon the inferiority as a race, of those
held in bondage, their freedom necessarily involved
immunity from, and protection against all discrimination
against them <em>because of their race</em>, in respect
of such civil rights as belong to freemen of other
races. Congress, therefore, under its express power
to enforce that amendment by appropriate legislation,
may enact laws to protect that people against
the deprivation, <em>because of their race</em>, of any civil rights
granted to other freemen in the same State; and such
legislation may be of a direct and primary character,
operating upon States, their officers and agents, and,
also, upon, at least, such individuals and corporations
as exercise public functions and wield power and authority
under the State.</p>

<p>To test the correctness of this position, let us
suppose that, prior to the adoption of the Fourteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Amendment, a State had passed a statute denying to
freemen of African descent, resident within its limits,
the same right which was accorded to white persons,
of making and enforcing contracts, and of inheriting,
purchasing, leasing, selling and conveying property;
or a statute subjecting colored people to severer punishment
for particular offences than was prescribed
for white persons, or excluding that race from the
benefit of the laws exempting homesteads from execution.
Recall the legislation of 1865-6 in some of
the States, of which this court, in the <cite>Slaughter-house
Cases</cite>, said, that it imposed upon the colored race
onerous disabilities and burdens; curtailed their
rights in the pursuits of life, liberty and property to
such an extent that their freedom was of little value;
forbade them to appear in the towns in any other
character than menial servants; required them to reside
on and cultivate the soil, without the right to
purchase or own it; excluded them from many occupations
of gain, and denied them the privilege of giving
testimony in the courts where a white man was a
party. 16 Wall. 57. Can there be any doubt that
all such enactments might have been reached by
direct legislation upon the part of Congress under its
express power to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment?
Would any court have hesitated to declare
that such legislation imposed badges of servitude in
conflict with the civil freedom ordained by that
amendment? That it would have been in conflict
with the Fourteenth Amendment, because inconsistent
with the fundamental rights of American citizenship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
does not prove that it would have been
consistent with the Thirteenth Amendment.</p>

<p>What has been said is sufficient to show that the
power of Congress under the Thirteenth Amendment
is not necessarily restricted to legislation against
slavery as an institution upheld by positive law, but
may be exerted to the extent, at least, of protecting
the liberated race against discrimination in respect of
legal rights belonging to freemen, where such discrimination
is based upon race.</p>

<p>It remains now to inquire what are the legal
rights of colored persons in respect of the accommodations,
privileges and facilities of public conveyances,
inns and places of public amusement?</p>

<p><em>First</em>, as to public conveyances on land and water.
In <cite>New Jersey Steam Navigation Co. <span class="antiqua">v.</span> Merchants’
Bank</cite>, 6 How. 344, this court, speaking by Mr. Justice
Nelson, said that a common carrier is “in the exercise
of a sort of public office, and has public duties
to perform, from which he should not be permitted to
exonerate himself without the assent of the parties
concerned.” To the same effect is <cite>Munn <span class="antiqua">v.</span> Illinois</cite>,
94 U. S. 113. In <cite>Olcott <span class="antiqua">v.</span> Supervisors</cite>, 16 Wall. 678,
it was ruled that railroads are public highways, established
by authority of the State for public use;
that they are none the less public highways, because
controlled and owned by private corporations; that
it is a part of the function of government to make
and maintain highways for the convenience of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
public; that no matter who is the agent, or what is
the agency, the function performed is <em>that of the
State</em>; that although the owners may be private
companies, they may be compelled to permit the public
to use these works in the manner in which they
can be used; that, upon these grounds alone, have
the courts sustained the investiture of railroad corporations
with the State’s right of eminent domain,
or the right of municipal corporations, under legislative
authority, to assess, levy and collect taxes to aid
in the construction of railroads. So in <cite>Township of
Queensbury <span class="antiqua">v.</span> Culver</cite>, 19 Wall. 83, it was said that a
municipal subscription of railroad stock was in aid
of the construction and maintenance of a public highway,
and for the promotion of a public use. Again,
in <cite>Township of Pine Grove <span class="antiqua">v.</span> Talcott</cite>, 19 Wall. 666:
“Though the corporation [railroad] was private, its
work was public, as much so as if it were to be constructed
by the State.” To the like effect are numerous
adjudications in this and the State courts
with which the profession is familiar, The Supreme
Judicial Court of Massachusetts, in <cite>Inhabitants of
Worcester <span class="antiqua">v.</span> The Western R. R. Corporation</cite>, 4 Met.
564, said in reference to a railroad:</p>

<p>“The establishment of that great thoroughfare is
regarded as a public work, established by public authority,
intended for the public use and benefit, the
use of which is secured to the whole community, and
constitutes, therefore, like a canal, turn-pike, or highway,
a public easement.... It is true that the real
and personal property, necessary to the establishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and management of the railroad, is vested in the corporation;
but it is in trust for the public.” In <cite>Erie,
etc., R. R. Co. <span class="antiqua">v.</span> Casey</cite>, 26 Penn St. 287, the court, referring
to an act repealing the charter of a railroad,
and under which the State took possession of the
road, said: “It is a public highway, solemnly devoted
to public use. When the lands were taken it
was for such use, or they could not have been taken
at all.... Railroads established upon land taken
by the right of eminent domain by authority of the
commonwealth, created by her laws as thorough-fares
for commerce, are her highways. No corporation
has property in them, though it may have franchises
annexed to and exercisable within them.”</p>

<p>In many courts it has been held that because of
the public interest in such a corporation the land of a
railroad company cannot be levied on and sold under
execution by a creditor. The sum of the adjudged
cases is that a railroad corporation is a government
agency, created primarily for public purposes, and
subject to be controlled for the public benefit. Upon
this ground the State, when unfettered by contract,
may regulate, in its discretion, the rates of fares of
passengers and freight. And upon this ground, too,
the State may regulate the entire management of
railroads in all matters affecting the convenience and
safety of the public; as, for example, by regulating
speed, compelling stops of prescribed length at stations,
and prohibiting discriminations and favoritism.
If the corporation neglect or refuse to discharge its
duties to the public, it may be coerced to do so by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
appropriate proceedings in the name or in behalf
of the State.</p>

<p>Such being the relations these corporations hold
to the public, it would seem that the right of a colored
person to use an improved public highway, upon the
terms accorded to freemen of other races, is as fundamental,
in the state of freedom established in this
country, as are any of the rights which my brethren
conceive to be so far fundamental as to be deemed
the essence of civil freedom. “Personal liberty consists,”
says Blackstone, “in the power of locomotion,
of changing situation, or removing one’s person to
whatever places one’s own inclination may direct,
without restraint, unless by due course of law.” But
of what value is this right of locomotion, if it may be
clogged by such burdens as Congress intended by the
act of 1875 to remove? They are burdens which lay
at the very foundation of the institution of slavery as
it once existed. They are not to be sustained, except
upon the assumption that there is, in this land of universal
liberty, a class which may still be discriminated
against, even in respect of rights of a character so
necessary and supreme, that deprived of their employment
in common with others, a freeman is not only
branded as one inferior and infected, but, in the competitions
of life, is robbed of some of the most essential
means of existence; and all this solely because
they belong to a particular race which the nation has
liberated. The Thirteenth Amendment alone obliterated
the race line, so far as all rights fundamental
in a state of freedom are concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Second</em>, as to inns. The same general observations
which have been made as to railroads are applicable
to inns. The word ‘inn’ has a technical legal
signification. It means, in the act of 1875, just what
it meant at common law. A mere private boarding-house
is not an inn, nor is its keeper subject to the
responsibilities, or entitled to the privileges of a common
innkeeper. “To constitute one an innkeeper,
within the legal force of that term, he must keep a
house of entertainment or lodging for all travelers or
wayfarers who might choose to accept the same, being
of good character or conduct.” Redfield on Carriers,
etc., § 775.</p>

<hr />

<p>The United States Government is divided into
three co-ordinate departments:—(1) Legislative, (2)
Executive, (3) Judiciary. These departments are an
obscure deception to the negro. These departments
are upheld and supported by 8,000,000 black people,
and scarcely one escapes the dreadful discrimination
which in all cases means respectable accommodation
for the white man and disrespectable accommodation
for the black man.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Salus-populi-supre Ma-est-lex.</span></h3>

<p>When the welfare of a race is evinced in the
supreme law of the nation, and that law disfranchises
that race, then where shall the race appeal. Certainly
the colored race has appealed to Almighty God, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
whom may glory and praise be given for ever. As
Abraham Lincoln was instrumental in bringing about
freedom of the black race, so will the Almighty plant
within the hearts of such heroes as John Brown and
Fred. Douglas a seed of right, and it will grow and
ultimately overshadow the wrong. It is noticeable
that the evil forces rush on the negro with one accord:
that is, all the leaders of the American Government
apparently have secret consultation as to the treatment
of a black man. Even merchants, hotel men,
livery stable men, news men, and train men, all drift
conjointly against the negro to uphold their own
affairs, and especially do the colored man out of his
rights and earnings. The following clipping from a
Decatur daily newspaper will serve readily in support
of the foregoing statement:—</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Under the Civil Rights Bill.</span></h3>

<p>“Nay Boggess was in Blue Mound yesterday to
prosecute a case where J. C. Coleman sues to recover
$200 damages from Landlord Blair. Coleman is a
negro and declares that he was denied entertainment
at Blair’s hostelry. The case was to have been heard
yesterday before Justice Tidd, but Coleman telegraphed
from McLean county that he was detained
there by the illness of his wife, and on this plea the
case was continued until Monday next. It is likely
that the case will be dismissed at Blue Mound and be
re-instituted in the circuit court.”</p>

<p>The above article appeared in one of the Decatur,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Ill., daily leading newspapers in the summer of
1894. The editorial staff no doubt were aware of
the procedure and termination of all such cases, otherwise
the prediction that the “case would be dismissed
in Blue Mound and re-instituted in the circuit court,”
could not have been so frankly and authentically
announced. The numerous disappointments attending
my struggle to obtain justice in this case are so
multitudinous space cannot just here be allotted for
further explanation. Some incidents connected with
the travel during the summer of 1894 in the “great”
State of Illinois are of praiseworthy importance to
the reader on other pages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">IMPOSITION.</span></h2>

<p>It may be conceded that the observations are
synonymous, in that they express the sum and substance
of the first observation under the caption <span class="smcap">Injustice</span>.
In the preceding chapter we have brought
out clearly the Discriminating elements. The imposing
forces expand as fast as the white population
increases in the Southern States, and has developed
into many Northern “quarters.” The great,
the small, the rich and the poor, the high and the
low, white persons, all have their way of bantering
their colored brother. As a rule young white men
and young colored men are at variance with each
other. The same may be said of young white and
colored women. The “whites” of both sexes avoid
politeness with the colored to show their superiority.
Children are innocent. The poor boy, whose father
is the servant of a millionaire, can usually find room
in the play yard of the millionaire’s children; but
this is not so in the case of the white and colored
boy. The white boy early learns that the colored
boy must eat last, drink last, pass through the gate
last, and have the last choice of the toys.</p>

<p>One of the most singular and inhuman habits
the American white people possess, is that of shirking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the colored people during luncheon. Their colored
cook may have handled and even partaken of every
piece in the dish; but the most refined, decent—lady
or gentleman alike—colored person is extremely abhorred
and debarred on this occasion. We note these
facts as local condition of affairs.</p>

<p>The general Imposition on the colored race are—(1)
Lynching, (2) Discount in wages, and (3) Immoral
conduct with colored women. Before beginning
to elucidate these points, it is well to determine
whether the black man is worthy of any defence
in this direction—is he qualified for a neighbor? or
does he intrude on the rights of the Government, or
on the municipal rights, or on individual rights? is he
a subject of charity, as many other foreign nationalities?
These vital considerations and most important
questions are answered to some extent in the
following clipping from the Chicago <cite>Inter-Ocean</cite>,
June 26, 1894:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Only 46 Out of 4,200.</span></p>

<p>“Some interesting statistics have been furnished
by the secretary of the School Children’s Aid Society
relative to the work done during the winter of 1893-94.
As is generally known, the society is an outgrowth
and under the direct patronage of the Chicago
Women’s Club. It was organized after the enactment
of the compulsory education law of Illinois for
the purpose of clothing the children of the poor who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
otherwise would be able to attend school. The past
season will long be remembered as one of unusual
suffering, and the society expended a sum amounting
to $8,521.29.</p>

<p>“The money was chiefly spent in purchasing
shoes, boys’ clothing, and material for girls’ dresses,
skirts, and aprons. The matter of nationality is a
most interesting item in the report. Of those aided,
1,115 were Irish, 995 German, 572 Americans, 328
Bohemians, 233 English, 184 Jews, 198 Italians, 156
Norwegians, 180 Swedes, 68 Scotch, 57 Danish, 48
French, 46 negroes, 6 Spanish, 6 Welsh, 5 Swiss.
The Swiss, French, and Spanish form a comparatively
small per cent. of the population of Chicago, while
the thrifty and industrious Scotch and Danes are
very numerous.</p>

<p>“The most striking feature, however,” continued
the <cite>Daily Inter-Ocean</cite>, June 26, 1894, “is that but
forty-six negroes received assistance, and this in the
face of the truth that our colored population numbers
many thousands. Of the forty-six, six were discovered
accidentally and sought out by the secretary,
but who themselves made no appeal for relief. The
mother had come to the rooms of the society for
work, and when questioned said that her husband had
been a janitor in a building which had been closed,
but had hope of getting work in the spring. In the
meantime, she said, the children could be kept at
home until then, when they could buy shoes for them
and send them to school. It is gratifying to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
that they were not forced to wait, but that their wants
were supplied at once.</p>

<p>“Another virtue credited the negroes by the
society is gratitude. Of all who were aided, with but
few exceptions, they alone expressed any appreciation
of what was done for them.</p>

<p>“This testimony must be of interest to those
who have always insisted that the negro is a chronic
beggar and hopelessly dependent. Out of 4,200 cases
assisted by the society during the entire winter, but
forty six were negroes.”</p>

</div>

<p>Thousands of similar words to the above could
be said of the black race. There are no noted thieves
in the race, such as bank robbers, train robbers, and
Government robbers—not traits of the race. We
thank our God that no Rŭb Burrows and Jesse James
have arose in the race of African descent. We may
therefore say with propriety, The black man is
worthy of defence. He is worthy of being exonerated
from his present imposed state.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lynching.</span></h3>

<p>With prefatory statements of our indebtedness
to Mrs. Ida B. Wells Barnett for her extensive <em>travels</em>
in Great Britain and America, delivering expressive
and impressive lectures against this horrible, disgraceful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and king of all impositions upon a downtrodden
people, we write what we know of the subject, and
supplement some cases denounced in “The Reason
Why,” by Mrs. Barnett. Lynching has grown to be
an event which elicits multitudes, composed of men,
women and children, to cheer the participants as
though some renowned act of heroism is being performed.
The newspapers have given space to eulogize
the lynchers instead of condemning them. The
journals of to-day have grown so high in public favor
that seven out of every ten readers will firmly believe
the current reports. Even some of the Northern
black people themselves are to some extent in sympathy
with the lynchers, believing that their own men
are so vile and brutish that they deserve such heinous
punishment.</p>

<p>The question is everywhere heard, “Why do
they lynch the colored people down South?” The
general presumption is that colored men are “struck”
after the white women. Why were they not hankering
after them during slavery? Why did the master
leave his slave to wait on his family during the war
of 1861-5, while he engaged in battle? Colored men
were honest in the dark days of slavery, and they are
honest now. The ascension of the colored people of
the South to high seats of honor, and the fear that
they will ultimately predominate, have some “say
so” in these lynches. I have known blood-thirsty
mobs to appoint one of their own men to assault
some young woman who would not yield to a member
of the mob, to black his face and fix like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
“Nigger,” and remain in secrecy until a chance presented
itself, then suddenly light upon his prey armed
with a revolver. After reaching his highest point of
ambition—the mob is called to lynch some innocent
black man for the outrageous deed of a man of another
color. The visit of Madame Barnett to England
in behalf of the black people of America, drew more
favor for the race than Hon. Fred. Douglass or some
other distinguished colored man could have drawn.
It was not a man defending his own sex, but a young
lady, having been educated at Holly Springs, Miss.,
and labored with her own people and for her own people
in the South, who went to England in defence of
the innocent men falling victims to the mobs, and
being deprived of legal hearing or trial. “Rape” is
the prevalent charge—the mob is the criterion. This
condition of things are grievous—and more so when
we see other accusations brought against men, women
and children of the black race, and lynchings
being the result before proper course has been taken
to decide whether they are innocent or guilty, which
will be further seen in the following contribution, by
Ida B. Wells Barnett:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lynch Law.</span><br />
<span class="smaller">BY IDA B. WELLS BARNETT.</span></h3>

<p>“Lynch Law,” says the <cite>Virginia Lancet</cite>, “as
known by that appellation, had its origin in 1780 in
a combination of citizens of Pittsylvania County, Virginia,
entered into for the purpose of suppressing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
trained band of horse-thieves and counterfeiters
whose well concocted schemes had bidden defiance to
the ordinary laws of the land, and whose success encouraged
and emboldened them in their outrages upon
the community. Col. Wm. Lynch drafted the
constitution for this combination of citizens, and
hence ‘Lynch Law’ has ever since been the name
given to the summary infliction of punishment by
private and unauthorized citizens.”</p>

<p>This law continues in force to-day in some of the
oldest states of the Union, whose courts of justice
have long been established, whose laws are executed
by white Americans. It flourishes most largely in
the states which foster the convict lease system, and
is brought to bear mainly, against the Negro. The
first fifteen years of his freedom he was murdered by
masked mobs for trying to vote. Public opinion having
made lynching for that cause unpopular, a new
reason is given to justify the murders of the past 15
years. The Negro was first charged with attempting
to rule white people, and hundreds were murdered on
that pretended supposition. He is now charged with
assaulting or attempting to assault white women.
This charge, as false as it is foul, robs us of the sympathy
of the world and is blasting the race’s good
name.</p>

<p>The men who make these charges encourage or
lead the mobs which do the lynching. They belong
to the race which holds Negro life cheap, which owns
the telegraph wires, newspapers, and all other communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
with the outside world. They write the
reports which justify lynching by painting the Negro
as black as possible, and those reports are accepted
by the press associations and the world without question
or investigation. The mob spirit has increased
with alarming frequency and violence. Over a thousand
black men, women and children have been thus
sacrificed the past ten years. Masks have long since
been thrown aside and the lynchings of the present
day take place in broad daylight. The sheriffs, police
and state officials stand by and see the work well
done. The coroner’s jury is often formed among
those who took part in the lynching and a verdict,
“Death at the hands of parties unknown to the jury”
is rendered. As the number of lynchings have increased,
so has the cruelty and barbarism of the
lynchers. Three human beings was burned alive in
civilized America during the first six months of this
year (1893). Over one hundred have been lynched
in this half year. They were hanged, then cut, shot
and burned.</p>

<p>This table shows (1) that only one-third of nearly
a thousand murdered black persons have been even
charged with the crime of outrage. This crime is
only so punished when white women accuse black
men, which accusation is never proven. The same
crime committed by Negroes against Negroes, or by
white men against black women is ignored even in
the law courts.</p>

<p>(2) That nearly as many were lynched for murder
as for the above crime, which the world believes
is the cause of all the lynchings. The world affects
to believe that <em>white</em> womanhood and childhood, surrounded
by their lawful protectors, are not safe in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
neighborhood of the black man, who protected and
cared for them during the four years of civil war.
The husbands, fathers and brothers of those white
women were away for four years, fighting to keep the
Negro in slavery, yet not one case of assault has ever
been reported!</p>

<p>(3) That “robbery, incendiarism, race prejudice,
quarrelling with white men, making threats, rioting,
miscegenation (marrying a white person), and burglary,”
are capital offences punishable by death when
committed by a black against a white person. Nearly
as many blacks were lynched for these charges (and
unproven) as for the crime of rape.</p>

<p>(4) That for nearly fifty of these lynchings no
reason is given. There is no demand for reasons, or
need of concealment for what no one is held responsible.
The simple word of any white person against a
Negro is sufficient to get a crowd of white men to
lynch a negro. Investigation as to the guilt or innocence
of the accused is never made. Under these
conditions, white men have only to blacken their
faces, commit crimes against the peace of the community,
accuse some Negro, nor rest till he is killed
by a mob. Will Lewis, an 18 year old Negro
youth was lynched at Tullahoma, Tennessee, August,
1891, for being “drunk and saucy to white folks.”</p>

<p>The women of the race have not escaped the
fury of the mob. In Jackson, Tennessee, in the
summer of 1886, a white woman died of poisoning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Her black cook was suspected, and as a box of
rat poison was found in her room, she was hurried
away to jail. When the mob had worked itself to
the lynching pitch, she was dragged out of jail,
every stitch of clothing torn from her body, and
she was hung in the public court-house square in
sight of everybody. Jackson is one of the oldest
towns in the State, and the State Supreme Court
holds its sittings there; but no one was arrested for
the deed—not even a protest was uttered. The husband
of the poisoned woman has since died a raving
maniac, and his ravings showed that he, and not the
poor black cook, was the poisoner of his wife. A
fifteen year old negro girl was hanged in Rayville,
Louisiana, in the Spring of 1892, on the same charge
of poisoning white persons. There was no more
proof or investigation of this case than the one in
Jackson. A negro woman, Lou Stevens, was hanged
from a railway bridge in Hollendale, Mississippi, in
1892. She was charged with being accessory to the
murder of her white paramour, who had shamefully
abused her.</p>

<p>In 1892 there were 240 persons lynched. The
entire number is divided among the following States:</p>

<p>In the case of the boy and girl above referred
to, their father, named Hastings, was accused of the
murder of a white man; his fourteen year old daughter
and sixteen year old son were hanged and their
bodies filled with bullets, then the father was also
lynched. This was in November, 1892, at Jonesville,
Louisiana.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>A lynching equally as cold-blooded took place
in Memphis, Tennessee, March, 1892. Three young
colored men in an altercation at their place of business,
fired on white men in self-defense. They were
imprisoned for three days, then taken out by the mob
and horribly shot to death. Thomas Moss, Will
Stewart and Calvin McDowell, were energetic business
men who had built up a flourishing grocery
business. This business had prospered and that of a
rival white grocer named Barrett had declined. Barrett
led the attack on their grocery which resulted in
the wounding of three white men. For this cause
were three innocent men barbarously lynched, and
their families left without protectors. Memphis is one
of the leading cities of Tennessee, a town of seventy-five
thousand inhabitants! No effort whatever was
made to punish the murderers of these three men. It
counted for nothing that the victims of this outrage
were three of the best known young men of a population
of thirty thousand colored people of Memphis.
They were the officers of the company which conducted
the grocery. Moss being the President, Stewart
the Secretary of the Company and McDowell
the Manager. Moss was in the Civil Service of the
United States as letter carrier, and all three were men
of splendid reputation for honesty, integrity and sobriety.
But their murderers, though well-known, have
never been indicted, were not even troubled with a
preliminary examination.</p>

<p>With law held in such contempt, it is not a matter
of surprise that the same city—one of the so-called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
queen cities of the South, should again give itself
over to a display of almost indescribable barbarism.
This time the mob made no attempt to conceal its
identity, but reveled in the contemplation of its feast
of crime. Lee Walker, a colored man was the victim.
Two white women complained that while driving
to town, a colored man jumped from a place of
concealment and dragged one of the two women
from the wagon, but their screams frightened him
away. Alarm was given that a Negro had made an
attempted assault upon the women and bands of men
set out to run him down. They shot a colored man
who refused to stop when called. It was fully ten
days before Walker was caught. He admitted that
he did attack the women, but that he made no attempt
to assault them; that he offered them no indecency
whatever, of which as a matter of fact, they never accused
him. He said he was hungry and he was determined
to have something to eat, but after throwing
one of the women out of the wagon, became frightened
and ran away. He was duly arrested and taken
to the Memphis jail. The fact that he was in prison
and could be promptly tried and punished did not
prevent the good citizens of Memphis from taking the
law in their own hands, and Walker was lynched.</p>

<p>The <cite>Memphis Commercial</cite> of Saturday, July 23,
contains a full account of the tragedy from which the
following extracts are made:</p>

<p>At 12 o’clock last night, Lee Walker, who attempted
to outrage Miss Mollie McCadden, last Tuesday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
morning, was taken from the county jail and
hanged to a telegraph pole just north of the prison.
All day rumors were afloat that with nightfall an attack
would be made upon the jail, and as everyone
anticipated that a vigorous resistance would be made,
a conflict between the mob and the authorities was
feared.</p>

<p>At 10 o’clock Capt. O’Haver, Sergt. Horan and
several patrol men were on hand, but they could do
nothing with the crowd. An attack by the mob was
made on the door in the south wall and it yielded.
Sheriff McLendon and several of his men threw themselves
into the breach, but two or three of the storming
party shoved by. They were seized by the police
but were not subdued, the officers refraining from using
their clubs. The entire mob might at first have
been dispensed by ten policemen who would use
their clubs, but the sheriff insisted that no violence
be done.</p>

<p>The mob got an iron rail and used it as a battering
ram against the lobby doors. Sheriff McLendon
tried to stop them, and some one of the mob knocked
him down with a chair. Still he counseled moderation
and would not order his deputies and the police
to disperse the crowd by force. The pacific policy
of the sheriff impressed the mob with the idea that
the officers were afraid, or at least would do them no
harm, and they redoubled their efforts, urged on by
a big switchman. At 12 o’clock the door of the prison
was broken in with a rail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the rapist was brought to the door,
calls were heard for a rope; then some one shouted
“Burn him!” But there was no time to make a fire.
When Walker got into the lobby a dozen of the men
began beating and stabbing him. He was half
dragged, half carried to the corner of Front street
and the alley between Sycamore and Mill, and hung
to a telephone pole.</p>

<p>Walker made a desperate resistance. Two men
entered his cell first and ordered him to come forth.
He refused and they failing to drag him out others
entered. He scratched and bit his assailants, wounding
several of them severely with his teeth. The mob
retaliated by striking and cutting him with fists and
knives. When he reached the steps leading down to
the door he made another stand and was stabbed again
and again. By the time he reached the lobby
his power to resist was gone, and he was shoved
along through the mob of yelling, cursing men and
boys, who beat, spat upon and slashed the wretched-like
demon. One of the leaders of the mob fell, and
the crowd walked ruthlessly over him. He was badly
hurt—a jawbone fractured and internal injuries inflicted.
After the lynching friends took charge of him.</p>

<p>The mob proceeded north on Front street with
the victim, stopping at Sycamore street to get a rope
from a grocery. “Take him to the iron bridge on
Main street,” yelled several men. The men who had
hold of the Negro were in a hurry to finish the job,
however, and when they reached the telephone pole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
at the corner of Front street and the first alley north
of Sycamore they stopped. A hastily improvised
noose was slipped over the Negro’s head and several
young men mounted a pile of lumber near the pole
and threw the rope over one of the iron stepping pins.
The Negro was lifted up until his feet were three feet
above the ground, the rope was made taut, and a
corpse dangled in mid-air. A big fellow who helped
lead the mob pulled the Negro’s legs until his neck
cracked. The wretch’s clothes had been torn off, and
as he swung, the man who pulled his legs mutilated
the corpse.</p>

<p>One or two knife cuts, more or less, made little
difference in the appearance of the dead rapist, however,
for before the rope was around his neck his skin
was cut almost to ribbons. One pistol shot was fired
while the corpse was hanging. A dozen voices protested
against the use of firearms, and there was no
more shooting. The body was permitted to hang for
half an hour, then it was cut down and the rope divided
among those who lingered around the scene of
the tragedy. Then it was suggested that the corpse
be burned, and it was done. The entire performance,
from the assault on the jail to the burning of the dead
Negro was witnessed by a score or so of policemen
and as many deputy sheriffs, but not a hand was
lifted to stop the proceedings after the jail door
yielded.</p>

<p>As the body hung to the telegraph pole, blood
streaming down from the knife wounds in his neck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
his hips and lower part of his legs also slashed with
knives, the crowd hurled expletives at him, swung his
body so that it was dashed against the pole, and, so
far from the ghastly sight proving trying to the
nerves, the crowd looked on with complaisance, if not
with real pleasure. The Negro died hard. The neck
was not broken, as the body was drawn up without
being given a fall, and death came by strangulation.
For fully ten minutes after he was strung up the chest
heaved occasionally and there were convulsive movements
of the limbs. Finally he was pronounced dead,
and a few minutes later Detective Richardson climbed
on a pile of staves and cut the rope. The body fell
in a ghastly heap, and the crowd laughed at the
sound and crowded around the prostrate body, a few
kicking the inanimate carcass.</p>

<p>Detective Richardson, who is also a deputy coroner,
then proceeded to impanel the following jury of
inquest: J. S. Moody, A. C. Waldran, B. J. Childs,
J. N. House, Nelson Bills, T. L. Smith, and A. Newhouse.
After viewing the body the inquest was adjourned
without any testimony being taken until 9
o’clock this morning. The jury will meet at the
coroner’s office, 51 Beale street, upstairs, and decide
on a verdict. If no witnesses are forthcoming, the
jury will be able to arrive at a verdict just the same,
as all members of it saw the lynching. Then some
one raised the cry of, “Burn him!” It was quickly
taken up and soon resounded from a hundred throats.
Detective Richardson for a long time, single handed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
stood the crowd off. He talked and begged the men
not to bring disgrace on the city by burning the
body, arguing that all the vengeance possible had
been wrought.</p>

<p>While this was going on a small crowd was
busy starting a fire in the middle of the street. The
material was handy. Some bundles of staves were
taken from the adjoining lumber yard for kindling.
Heavier wood was obtained from the same source,
and coal oil from a neighboring grocery. Then the
cries of “Burn him! Burn him!” were redoubled.</p>

<p>Half a dozen men seized the naked body. The
crowd cheered. They marched to the fire, and giving
the body a swing, it was landed in the middle of the
fire. There was a cry for more wood, as the fire had
begun to die, owing to the long delay. Willing hands
procured the wood, and it was piled up on the Negro,
almost, for a time, obscuring him from view. The
head was in plain view, as also were the limbs, and
one arm which stood out high above the body, the
elbow crooked, held in that position by a stick of
wood. In a few moments the hands began to swell,
then came great blisters over all the exposed parts of
the body; then in places the flesh was burned away
and the bones began to show through. It was a
horrible sight, one which perhaps none there had ever
witnessed before. It proved too much for a large part
of the crowd, and the majority of the mob left very
shortly after the burning began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>But a large number stayed, and were not a bit
set back by the sight of a human body being burned
to ashes. Two or three white women, accompanied
by their escorts, pushed to the front to obtain an unobstructed
view, and looked on with astonishing coolness
and nonchalance. One man and woman brought
a little girl, not over 12 years old, apparently their
daughter, to view a scene which was calculated to
drive sleep from the child’s eyes for many nights, if
not to produce a permanent injury to her nervous
system. The comments of the crowd were varied.
Some remarked on the efficacy of this style of cure
for rapists, others rejoiced that men’s wives and
daughters were now safe from this wretch. Some
laughed as the flesh cracked and blistered, and while
a large number pronounced the burning of a dead
body as a useless episode, not in all that throng was
a word of sympathy heard for the wretch himself.</p>

<p>The rope that was used to hang the Negro, and
also that which was used to lead him from the jail,
were eagerly sought by relic hunters. They almost
fought for a chance to cut off a piece of rope, and in
an incredibly short time both ropes had disappeared
and were scattered in the pockets of the crowd in
sections of from an inch to six inches long. Others
of the relic hunters remained until the ashes cooled
to obtain such ghastly relics as the teeth, nails and
bits of charred skin of the immolated victim of his
own lust. After burning the body the mob tied a
rope around the charred trunk and dragged it down
Main Street to the court house, where it was hanged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
to a centre pole. The rope broke and the corpse
dropped with a thud, but it was again hoisted, the
charred legs barely touching the ground. The teeth
were knocked out and the finger nails cut off as souvenirs.
The crowd made so much noise that the
police interfered. Undertaker Walsh was telephoned
for, who took charge of the body and carried it to his
establishment, where it will be prepared for burial in
the potter’s field to-day.</p>

<p>A prelude to this exhibition of 19th century barbarism
was the following telegram received by the
Chicago <cite>Inter-Ocean</cite>, at 2 o’clock, Saturday afternoon—ten
hours before the lynching:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Memphis, Tenn.</span>, July 22. To <cite>Inter-Ocean</cite>, Chicago.</p>

<p>“Lee Walker, colored man, accused of raping
white women, in jail here, will be taken out and
burned by whites to-night. Can you send Miss Ida
Wells to write it up? Answer. R. M. Martin, with
<cite>Public Ledger</cite>.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <cite>Public Ledger</cite> is one of the oldest evening
daily papers in Memphis, and this telegram shows
that the intentions of the mob were well known long
before they were executed. The personnel of the
mob is given by the Memphis <cite>Appeal-Avalanche</cite>. It
says, “At first it seemed as if a crowd of roughs were
the principals, but as it increased in size, men in all
walks of life figured as leaders, although the majority
were young men.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the punishment meted out to a Negro,
charged, not with rape, but attempted assault, and
without any proof as to his guilt, for the women were
not given a chance to identify him. It was only a
little less horrible than the burning alive of Henry
Smith, at Paris, Texas, February 1st, 1893, or that of
Edward Coy, in Texarkana, Texas, February 20,
1892. Both were charged with assault on white
women, and both were tied to the stake and burned
while yet alive, in the presence of ten thousand persons.
In the case of Coy, the white woman in the
case, applied the match, even while the victim protested
his innocence.</p>

<p>In some of these cases the mob affects to believe
in the Negro’s guilt. The world is told that the white
woman in the case identifies him, or the prisoner
“confesses.” But in the lynching which took place
in Barnwell County, South Carolina, April 24, 1893,
the mob’s victim, John Peterson, escaped and placed
himself under Governor Tillman’s protection; not
only did he declare his innocence, but offered to prove
an alibi with white witnesses. Before his witnesses
could be brought, the mob arrived at the Governor’s
mansion and demanded the prisoner. He was given
up, and although the white woman in the case said
he was <em>not</em> the man, he was hanged 24 hours after,
and over a thousand bullets fired into his body, on
the declaration that “a crime had been committed,
and some one had to hang for it.”</p>

<p>The lynching of C. J. Miller, at Bardwell, Kentucky,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
July 7, 1893, was on the same principle. Two
white girls were found murdered near their home on
the morning of July 5th; their bodies were horribly
mutilated. Although their father had been instrumental
in the prosecution and conviction of one of
his white neighbors for murder, that was not considered
as a motive. A hue and cry was raised that
some Negro had committed rape and murder, and
a search was immediately begun for a Negro. A
blood hound was put on the trail which he followed
to the river and into the boat of a fisherman named
Gordon. This fisherman said he had rowed a white
man, or a very fair mulatto across the river at six
o’clock the evening before. The bloodhound was
carried across the river, took up the trail on the Missouri
side, and ran about two hundred yards to the
cottage of a white farmer, and there lay down refusing
to go further.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a strange Negro had been arrested in
Sikestown, Missouri, and the authorities telegraphed
that fact to Bardwell, Kentucky. The sheriff, without
requisition, escorted the prisoner to the Kentucky
side and turned him over to the authorities who accompanied
the mob. The prisoner was a man with
dark brown skin; he said his name was Miller and
that he had never been in Kentucky. The fisherman
who had said the man he rowed over was white, when
told by the sheriff that he would be held responsible
as knowing the guilty man, if he failed to identify
the prisoner, said Miller was the man. The mob
wished to burn him then, about ten o’clock in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
morning, but Mr. Ray, the father of the girls, with
great difficulty urged them to wait till three o’clock
that afternoon. Confident of his innocence, Miller
remained cool, while hundreds of drunken, heavily
armed men raged about him. He said: “My name
is C. J. Miller, I am from Springfield, Ill., my wife
lives at 716 North Second Street. I am here among
you to-day looked upon as one of the most brutal
men before the people. I stand here surrounded by
men who are excited; men who are not willing to
let the law take its course, and as far as the law is
concerned, I have committed no crime, and certainly
no crime gross enough to deprive me of my life or
liberty to walk upon the green earth. I had some
rings which I bought in Bismarck of a Jew peddler.
I paid him $4.50 for them. I left Springfield on the
first day of July and came to Alton. From Alton I
went to East St. Louis, from there to Jefferson Barracks,
thence to Desoto, thence to Bismarck; and to
Piedmont, thence to Poplar Bluff, thence to Hoxie, to
Jonesboro, and then on a local freight to Malden,
from there to Sikeston. On the 5th day of July, the
day I was supposed to have committed the offense, I
was at Bismarck.”</p>

<p>Failing in any way to connect Miller with the
crime, the mob decided to give him the benefit of the
doubt and <em>hang, instead of burn him</em>, as was first intended.
At 3 o’clock, the hour set for the execution,
the mob rushed into the jail, tore off Miller’s clothing
and tied his shirt around his loins. Some one
said the rope was “a white man’s death,” and a log-chain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
nearly a hundred feet in length, weighing nearly
a hundred pounds was placed about his neck. He
was led through the street in that condition and
hanged to a telegraph pole. After a photograph of
him was taken as he hung, his fingers and toes cut
off, and his body otherwise horribly mutilated, it was
burned to ashes. This was done within twelve hours
after Miller was taken prisoner. Since his death, his
assertions regarding his movements have been proven
true. But the mob refused the necessary time for
investigation.</p>

<p>No more appropriate close for this chapter can
be given than an editorial quotation from that most
consistent and outspoken journal the <cite>Inter-Ocean</cite>.
Commenting on the many barbarous lynchings of
these two months (June and July) in its issue of
August 5th, 1893, it says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“So long as it is known that there is one charge
against a man which calls for no investigation before
taking his life there will be mean men seeking revenge
ready to make that charge. Such a condition
would soon destroy all law. It would not be tolerated
for a day by white men. But the Negroes have
been so patient under all their trials that men who
no longer feel that they can safely shoot a Negro for
attempting to exercise his right as a citizen at the
polls are ready to trump up any other charge that
will give them the excuse for their crime. It is a
singular coincidence that as public sentiment has
been hurled against political murders there has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
a corresponding increase in lynchings on the charge
of attacking white women. The lynchings are conducted
in much the same way that they were by the
Ku-Klux Klans when Negroes were mobbed for attempting
to vote. The one great difference is in the
cause which the mob assigns for its action.</p>

<p>“The real need is for a public sentiment in favor
of enforcing the law and giving every man, white and
black, a fair hearing before the lawful tribunals. If
the plan suggested by the Charleston <cite>News and
Courier</cite> will do this let it be done at once. No one
wants to shield a fiend guilty of these brutal attacks
upon unprotected women. But the Negro has as
good a right to a fair trial as the white man, and the
South will not be free from these horrible crimes of
mob law so long as the better class of citizens try to
find excuse for recognizing Judge Lynch.”</p>

<p>The lynching of C. J. Miller at Bardwell, Ky.,
July 7, 1893, referred to in Madam Barnett’s writings,
has not only been declared barbarism, outrageous,
and outlawry, but a mistake by the lynchers themselves,
as stated in Madam Barnett’s comment.</p>

<p>While in Fulton, Ky., a few days after the horrible
deed of lynching Mr. Miller by the people of
Bardwell and volunteers, the writer saw thousands of
bills posted, nullifying the action of the mob in the
case of Mr. Miller, and urging that some other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
“Nigger” be implicated in the crime, and lynched to
“make up” for the death of the two Ray sisters.</p>

<p>Fulton is situated on the Illinois Central R. R.,
about 28 miles south of Bardwell. Every train from
the South bound for the Chicago World’s Columbian
Exposition, bore a host of interested passengers to
see the ashes of the innocent man burned at Bardwell.
Applications were made to the conductors to
stop long enough at Bardwell to see the “sight.”
The writer was the only one of his nationality on
board the train which stopped at the scene. On the
morning of July 28th, 1893, in the business part of
the town of Bardwell, about 50 yards from the Illinois
Central station, the remains of one of the most uncivil
deeds perpetrated upon an innocent man in a
Christian country and civil government, could be
pitifully viewed from the platform or window of the
car.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Coleman at Decatur, Ill.</span></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Imposition in Northern “Quarters.”</span></p>

<p>Decatur has been mentioned elsewhere in this
book. It is the third railway centre in the 3rd productive
State in the U. S. Its population is 20,000.
It is about 40 miles from Lincoln, where a log cabin,
as a relic of the martyred President, Abraham Lincoln,
remains. There are three Churches of color represented
in Decatur. The first innocent blood was drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
from the neck of a colored man in 1893, and shed
upon the city of Decatur by some of its “respectable”
citizens, men and women. My introduction to
Decatur was in June, 1894, during my visit to a
“colored camp meeting.” I heard it noised around
that a Mr. Jackson, waiter of St Nickels Hotel, had
been arrested and placed in jail on a charge of
attempted “rape.” The Lynch alarm had been
sounded, which aroused the sympathy of the colored
population to protect Jackson. Those who showed
cowardice were invited to a speech delivered by the
writer, urging the colored men to consolidate their
forces and preclude the mob from the prisoner. Much
enthusiasm was manifested while the speech was
being made, and at the conclusion preparation was
immediately begun to resist the murderers. Guns,
revolvers, swords, knives and clubs of any dangerous
description were collected and laid by for battle. The
municipal authority showed no protection, <i>pro et con</i>,
the movements. By 8 p.m. on the evening appointed
by the mob gang, the colored men and boys were
arranged in military form, being under command of
general and captain, etc. The army received cheers
for management, courage and promptness from the
better classes of the white population.</p>

<p>The jail in which this prisoner was, was about four
blocks from the main part of the city. The white
boys who usually follow shows and excitement, had
occupied the nearest seats to the jail at an early hour,
anxiously waiting to see the end of Jackson’s life.
As I advanced accompanied by my guard, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
young spectators asked with a tone of delight, “Are
they going to lynch the nigger to-night?” I could
but give the answer, “No.” Having instructed all
concerned to show no uncivility to any person, but at
the rise of war, put forth every exertion to save the
life of the prisoner. Orders were given to the band
to surround the prison. Just now I began to experience
some of the actual “turns” of the battle-field.
300 black faces at one signal dotted in separate groups
on all sides of the jail and court-house. At 9 o’clock
a man of low stature passed along the main street,
smoking sumptuously, with a rope which had been
presented specially for the lynching of Jackson. The
rope-man was so completely absorbed in the occupation,
he failed to see those who had come to see justice
meted out to the prisoner, who so well deserved
it. Some of his constituency within the court-rooms
informed him of the danger in store; he then accepted
of a hard bed in the building for the night. At
this crisis absolute calmness seemed to prevail which
continued until between 1 and 2 a.m., when the watchmen
were disturbed by the yells of intoxicated men.
Noises of teams, wagons, riders on horse-back, and
some “foolers,” all winding their way from country
villages and bush-towns into the “big town” to kill
the old “nigger.” The night policemen who finally
showed some degree of courtesy to the colored band,
conveyed the information to the mob that “300
black men lie in wait for you; if the mob attempts
to take Jackson to-night, no small number of lives
will be lost”. With this intelligence the blood-thirsty
gang received orders from their captain on a sub-way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
bridge to “retreat until the next night.” A reporter
from the leading newspaper of the city, who had taken
in the general outlook of the affair, asked permission
to address the colored “boys.” Receiving permission
from the proper source, he then rode amid the
cool headed body of men. Lighting from his horse
said, “Gentlemen, I understand that you have
gathered to protect Mr. Jackson. Now I wish to inform
you that you need not fear any thing like a
mob from any person in Decatur.” “But they are
coming from the country,” came a voice from some
person in the rear of the crowd. “Mr. Jackson is
known here as a gentleman,” continued the speaker.
“The circumstances in connection with this case I
am fully acquainted with. Mr. Jackson and this
woman were intimate, and some business men in
town can verify the fact that Mr. Jackson gave her
money two days ago. The story that Mr. Jackson
was found in her room on her bed with a revolver a
few evenings ago, is true. He was not there to
force, but because she asked him there, being afraid
of a policeman just outside the door. She cried out
to secure herself from the law.” These words were
received by the company with profound respect. The
Decatur papers verified the reporter’s statements.</p>

<p>This is not, however, the end of the struggle for
life. The spirit of protection was intense, and grew
parallel with the “lynch fever.” The following evening
a greater representation of the colored population
appeared on the scene. Those who failed to secure
themselves with arms the previous evening, came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
better fortified; but no further attempt to enter the
jail was made by the “outlawers.” The third night,
the municipal power intervened, and chastised the
tumultousness. This was begun by the arrest of
one of the colored company, Mr. Artist, who
had occupied a seat in the park, which faces the front
street, and who had two shot guns, and was repeatedly
told to leave. This he refused to do. On this ground
he was imprisoned. A committee composed of Mr.
J. Artist, Mr. Oliphant, and the writer called on the
Mayor. His Honor cordially received the committee,
and assured the committee that “nothing to hinder
the colored citizens from standing for themselves will
be done. Mr. Artist will be released to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>From these proceedings the reader is not to conclude
that such an act would stop the Southern lynchings.
In a Northern city of so small a population of
colored people as Decatur, it is reasonable to suppose
that race war would not be tolerated, while such
would be the case in the South. That the city officials
were friendly to the action of the colored people is
seen in the fact that there was no interference with
them until the third night of the warfare, and the releasement
of Mr. Artist. It should be remembered
that the colored citizens were in every respect submissive
to the law, only that the condition of their
surroundings had grown to the doctrine, “Eye for
eye, and tooth for tooth.”</p>

<p>With an outstretched hand to fallen humanity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and uplifted voice to God, accompanied by a painful
heart, I must here appeal to Scripture facts. “All
things work together for good to them that love God,
to them who are the called according to His purpose.”
Rev. Mr. Mudd, a distinguished divine, connected
himself with the colored citizens of Decatur, striving
to uphold the right in the case of Mr. Jackson,
who through the instrumentality of his race was
given a fair trial.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">WAGES.</span></h2>

<p>Scarcely any of the wealthy people of the North,
and thinkers on vital questions of the day in European
nations, properly consider the salary of colored
laborers of the South, as a comparison to that of the
white laborer. It is universally admitted that the
colored race has made rapid progress—progress worthy
of praise. But in the face of destitution, educational
endeavorment, exertions put forth to erect
church edifices, and imposition as described in the
preceding chapter, thousands of good people stand
and say: “The negroes are allowed to work in nearly
all the branches of labor that are in the South, and
why should we help them to build their schools and
churches, since they have been freed long enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
look after themselves from a financial standpoint?
and why should we try to assist them in getting their
rights at law, when they don’t try to assist themselves
when they are outraged by the lynchers, there being
as many or more colored people in some States than
white people?” If the negro was allowed the same
chance or the same wages as his white brother, then
we could to some extent join with the above in
asking, why? But few of the many colleges
and churches of the colored people are paid for.
Could colored millionaires be expected within 35
years of freedom? No. There are some pursuing
riches. In the State of Mississippi many colored
persons owned “plantations.” Only owned until
some “heir” arise to force them by “law” to disown
their property. This course of defrauding the
colored people out of their stringent and honest earnings
has existed many years. In consideration of
these things we must conclude that donations amounting
to enough to pay off debts of colored institutions,
such as that of Payne Theological Seminary should
be given by those who have received abundantly from
the hands of a Father, who is rich in houses and lands,
and holdeth the wealth of the world in His hand.</p>

<p>In sustenance of what has been said as a proof
of the Southern colored labor being discounted, in
that a minority of those who are fitted for all departments
of work are not employed, we give a clipping
from the <cite>Detroit Evening News</cite>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Wages in the South.</span></p>

<p>“The Chattanooga Tradesmen has made a statistical
examination of the white and colored labor of
the Southern States. From the reports received from
employers of nearly 100,000 hands, 58 per cent. of
the employees are white and 42 are colored. One-third
of the whole number are termed skilled laborers,
only 10 per cent. of whom are colored.</p>

<p>“A remarkable fact brought out by this investigation
is, that over 90 per cent. of these workmen are
native born; 61 per cent. of the employers said all
their help were natives of the south, and only 19 per
cent. reported that they employed as many as half
natives and half of northern or foreign birth.</p>

<p>“The Tradesman says the reports show wages
paid to skilled workmen average $2.51 to whites and
$1.58 to colored. Unskilled whites average $1.14,
and colored $1.02 per day. The highest rate per day
reported was $4, paid to expert brickmakers. Foundrymen
average $2.87 to whites and $1.62 to colored
skilled workers. Carriage makers average $3.37; no
skilled colored carriage makers are reported. In
lumber making, white men average $2.78, and colored
$1.62. Coal miners average $2.33 for whites and
$1.62 for colored. Stone workers average $2.87
for whites and $1.42 for colored. Returns from a
large number of miscellaneous occupations show that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
skilled white workers average $2.43, and skilled
colored men $1.70 per day.</p>

<p>“As compared with northern or foreign labor, 72
per cent. of the employers say their southern labor is
as good; and 5 per cent. are in doubt.</p>

<p>“As to the comparative value of white and
colored skilled labor, 46 per cent. of the employers
say that it is about equal, 43 per cent. say that negro
labor is inferior, and 11 per cent. are in doubt. As
to common labor, 54 per cent. say the white and
black are equal in efficiency, 29 per cent. that the
colored labor is the better, and 17 per cent. that the
colored men are inferior to whites.</p>

<p>“As to whether white and colored common laborers
are improving in skill, 35 per cent. of the employers
say that they are, 18 per cent. that they are
not, 17 per cent. that the whites are improving more
than the colored, and 2 per cent. that the colored are
improving more than the whites. Twelve per cent.
think that colored laborers are improving, 4 per cent.
that the whites are retrograding, and 12 per cent. no
improvement in the colored laborers.</p>

<p>“That the white and colored laborers work together
harmoniously is asserted by 58 per cent. of the
employers, while 9 per cent. declare to the contrary.
Twenty-one per cent. reply affirmatively, with qualifications,
and 12 per cent. say that harmony exists because
whites overrule the colored workers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Booker T. Washington advocates the cause
of the race from an industrial point of view. His
idea is valuable, and a condition to which many must
concede, if high attainments in laborious circles are
sought for. While Mr. Washington opens this channel,
his labors must be preceded by a successful surveyor,
so that the grounded implements may be put
in action. “Why stand ye here all the day idle?”
will not then be asked. Give positions suitable to
the accomplishment of the colored men and women,
boys and girls, and do away with Discrimination and
Imposition of Injustice upon them. And then “let
them alone.”</p>

<p>Bishop Benjamin F. Lee stands foremost in the
educational career, but always connects “work” with
his platform. He is not satisfied with having filled
the souls of men with the glorious tidings of the truth,
but may very appropriately be called the “surveyor”
for the physical wants of the people.</p>

<p>As to colored school teachers, etc., wages have
been arranged to a low price. Some second grade
teachers receiving from 25 dollars to 30 dollars per
month; while some 3rd grade teachers receive a stipulated
salary of from 10 to 15 dollars per month.
Such a reduction in these cases can only be attributed
to the unfair basis upon which the Boards of Education
conduct the matters to favor their people and
impede the progress of the colored race.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">“THE JIM CROW CAR.”</span></h2>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">The titles—Porters—Baggage-men—Coleman on the
“G. P.” 1892—Mississippi Delta.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus far we have seen that mal-treatment, deception
in court, murdering, etc., are associated with
the “Jim Crow Car,” for the title itself means fraud—and
all debauchery and injustice meted out to
the colored race are material in the “Jim Crow Car.”
If we are to see the state of things as they are in
various parts of the world, we are generally conveyed
by “the train,” as a preference when it is serviceable.
In countries where there is no R. R. locomotives, the
stages of higher civilization have not yet been reached.
The first thing therefore, right or wrong, coming under
our notice by the way, is on the “front.”</p>

<p>The car in which the colored people are forced
to ride is not marked “Jim Crow Car.” Most every
R. R. line has a different mark. As a rule “Colored”
just over the entrance is marked on the cars designed
for the colored people on the majority of roads.
Other marks are: “For Colored People,” “For
Africans,” (L. R. &amp; M. R. R.) “Negroes,” etc. Regular
colored passengers are so well acquainted with
the style and inferiority of their car, it is hardly necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to read the sign. Carthage, Miss., is the
county seat of Leake County, and 31 miles from the
railroad lines. Many of its inhabitants have never
seen a train. Nevertheless, most of the colored citizens
have heard that the train is a pretty thing, but
the colored folks must pay as much to ride as white
passengers, and yet occupy an awful “Jim Crow Car.”</p>

<p>Two colored men having decided to go off, came
to Goodman to “take” the train. When the train
arrived that they desired, the smoke prevented them
from seeing the “colored” car near the engine. The
colored passengers stood quite a distance from the
site, refusing to board it, from the very reason that
they feared the smoke. They admired the cars for
white passengers. Although they had purchased
their tickets, they decided to wait for the colored car
to come along. After the train made its departure
from the station, the two passengers went in hiding,
being afraid that they would be arrested for not going
up to the engine to get the car. Shortly a freight
run in, and the two passengers fully concluded “that
must be that ‘Jim Crow Car’ for the colored folks
that we have heard so much talk about.” With this
idea they aimed to board it, when they were considered
intruders, and were driven back to their
homes.</p>

<h3>PORTERS.</h3>

<p>The porters on the passenger trains are chiefly
colored men. Their politeness to passengers and
distinct voices in calling stations, render their appropriateness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
for the position. They assist in handling
baggage, but they are very rarely allowed to assist
colored ladies on and off the train. They must get
off possibly with babies in their arms and valises.
The porter is allowed to help white ladies off by
taking the packages and valises to the platform of
the depot, the brakeman and conductor being too
aristocratic to do such, like most southerners are.</p>

<h3>BAGGAGEMEN.</h3>

<p>There are white and colored employees in large
baggage rooms. The bulk of the white baggagemen
abhor the idea of carrying a colored person’s baggage
to the baggage car, although it is checked. They
sometimes order our intelligent colored gentleman to
convey his own baggage to the train, especially if he
looks like a “drummer” or travelling salesman.</p>

<p>A young man travelling for a colored Building
and Loan firm was shot and killed at a little town
south of Jackson, Miss., by a baggageman, who
failed to compel him to carry his own baggage. The
same style of marking on the door of railway cars for
colored people is on the doors of waiting rooms.
Colored department porters are employed to see that
the black people go to their room, but is not allowed
to resist white people putting packages and tying
their dogs in the colored room. White convicts are
held in the colored waiting rooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Coleman on the “G. P.”</span></h3>

<p>Concluding my Southern tour in 1892, I left
Birmingham, Ala., Nov. 1st, 1892, bound for Durant,
Miss. A large number of passengers were on board
when we arrived at Coalsburg, a little town situated
in the coal regions of Alabama, about 15 miles from
Birmingham. The depot agent having flagged the
train, ran to the conductor exclaiming:</p>

<p>“You can’t go under two hours!”</p>

<p>“Why can’t I?” asked the conductor. “Why
that east-bound local have jumped the track.”</p>

<p>A vast convict farm is under cultivation by
colored convicts at Coalsburg. To see men and women
tied together and working under “Bull whips”
was a delightful scene to the white passengers, both
men and women. The farm is about 60 yards from
the depot.</p>

<p>All sorts and conditions of humanity can be
seen. Strange it may seem to true man and womanhood,
the fact remains that the brutalized state
of the colored men and women is the pride of the
Southern white element. The passengers stand with
pleasure viewing the convicts as they are lashed and
forced to do excessive work. A man who had been
on the farm two years, charged with stealing a pair of
boots, attempts to escape, when four white men on
mules and a train of hounds pursue him. An old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
ex-slave holder, standing in an attitude to take fine
view of the proceedings, smilingly said: “That looks
like old times.” Convicts are treated more cruel than
the slaves were during American slavery.</p>

<p>In fact the convict lease system is a method of
revenge. There are some ex-slave holders who
think that the “nigger” should be “paid” for fighting
against the South for freedom, and now making
it felt and known that they are a main factor in the
common wealth. The convict farms have grown numerous
in the Southern States as a means of binding
the Negro down to white masters. Ned Richardson
may justly bear the blame of causing more immorality
and disgrace upon the colored race in his dominion
than the slave trade in Africa to-day. The convict
lease system is a satanic giant leading to
degradation and ruin thousands of young men and
women, whom, if they had privilege of a house of
correction, would accomplish many good deeds for
their country, and Christ, and the Church.</p>

<p>When Mr. D. L. Moody preached at Massey
Music Hall, Wednesday, Oct. 13th, 1897, at 3 p.m.,
he elicited about 5,000 people. Before beginning his
sermon he made some interesting statements concerning
the great work which he had done in his efforts
to supply the jails in the United States with reading
matter to be put in the hands of the prisoners. Concluding,
he asked his audience to contribute $500 to
the same scheme in Canada. During his fervent and
explicit remarks the lamentable thought of the Convict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Lease system presented itself to me. Though
recognizing the work done by the speaker in the
United States as a source of spiritual help to the
colored prisoners, as well as the white ones, I am convinced
that such influential ambassadors of God as
Mr. Moody and Mr. Jones could abate the intense evil
in the promoters of working convicts, in a worse way
than any farmer would dare to work his horses in
the north and in many parts of the south.</p>

<p>At the close of Mr. Moody’s service I was profoundly
touched with the idea of asking the evangelist
to protest against southern heathenism. When
the rush to shake hands with the speaker had ceased,
I could not refrain from simply asking Mr. Moody to
preach against the convict lease system when he
returned south.</p>

<p>The Democratic party in the State of Alabama,
during the State election in 1892, made the convict
lease system a plank in their platform, declaring that
the diabolical system would be annihilated if the
party gained the election. A political course in the
pursuit of destroying such an influence and extensive
evil will not do the amount of durable good as will
the true Christian principles thoroughly stamped in
the hearts of the upholders of such an inhuman system.
One political party may abolish it, and another
reinstate it. It is necessary, therefore, that the way
of convincing the heathen abroad be given to erroneous
and barbaric tendencies everywhere. About nine-tenths
of the convicts in the United States are colored.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
When I visited Fletz’s farm about 3 miles south of
Winona, Miss., in 1891, there were no whites. The
convicts are not only leased to work on farms, but to
railway contractors and mining companies, etc. The
States tolerating the convict lease system receive a
revenue.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">“Kidnapped” Rock Diggers.</span></h3>

<p>Another incident noticeable on my journey to
Durant, Nov. 1st, ’92, is the fact that in the mountainous
regions lying on both sides of the Georgia
Pacific Road, is rock suitable for railway bridges, etc.
After receiving orders to leave Coalsburg, the conductor
gave the ordinary notice, “All aboard.” I
need not mention the various expressions of joy to
be leaving a place of sorrow and woe. We had not
gone more than 40 miles when a company of colored
men, directed by a white man, boarded our train.
The porter immediately gave the information that
trouble was awaiting the colored company, of which
they were not aware. Just about 35 miles down the
road is a path leading out to a rock den, they will
have to go about 18 miles back in the woods to find
it, there they will be worked. Some of them will be
worked to death without a cent of pay, said the porter.
When they arrived at their destination, the
ghostly “thicket” at once attracted my attention.
Like dumb driven cattle, the men, with unbalanced
luggage, over stepped the rugged mountain, some of
whom will never return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>The Georgia Pacific Railroad is systematized
strictly on Southern principles. Having roughly
split bottom seats on the “colored car.” While at
the Union Station in Birmingham, Ala., en route for
Atlanta, Ga., we beheld such a pitiful condition of
three colored ladies. Those who have not in any
way come in contact with such a state of human life
as seen in this car, can only marvel at our story, and
question whether such moral character exists amid
such a tremendous flow of offensiveness and pragmatical
elements.</p>

<p>In the car with the three colored ladies were five
convicts chained down to their seats in a most ghastly
condition, and 15 white men. The ladies were
compelled to hoist the windows in hope of shirking
the profane language and intense heat and smoke
from 15 cigars. The ladies were evidently professional
ladies, and of no mean ability and character,
but their high attainments were depreciated,
being told abruptly, “Go in that car there, that’s the
nigger car.” Many ministers and other representative
colored men are smokers per force. They must ride
in cars with the lowest smoking classes, but when
the smokers are through, retire to the “white car.”
Many persons who would never smoke, are forced to
smoke to protect their system during their ride in a
car filled with deathly odor.</p>

<h3>MISSISSIPPI “DELTA.”</h3>

<p>The real state of affairs in the Mississippi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
“Delta” or “Bottoms,” are unknown to those who
have not travelled the plantations and rivers, viewing
the situation of the people as they are. Indeed many
parts of that turbid valley are inhabited by a people
whose object is to humiliate the farmer as did the
slave holder in his time. Newspapers and other
mediums of spreading the happenings abroad are not
used. This dismal section of country lies about 50
miles west of the Illinois Central Railroad, separated
from Arkansas by the Mississippi River. There are
two other smaller rivers, viz.: Yazoo and Tallahatchie.
On the banks of these rivers are colored immigrants
from many southern States, with the hope of
bettering their condition.</p>

<p>Soon after slavery many men, women and children,
exiled to the Mississippi Delta, the employers, to
curtail railroad expenses, put the emigrants in freight
box cars, after getting them a distance from their
homes. Their present condition is grievous and
miserable, some plantations having as many as 500
employees and a white family. The agents are what
the overseer has once been. The general environments
are such that even 500 persons must stoop to
the command of 4 or 5 men. Some laborers have
not had a payment for their work. They are furnished
with pickled pork and corn bread for food, but
few of them are allowed to have money. Wooden
cheques from five cents and upward are paid to those
who pay to the Church. In this case the cheques are
only good at the plantation store. That which 25
cents could profitably buy in the Dominion of Canada<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
or the northern States, costs one dollar at the “plantation
store.” Cotton is the chief product; and owing
to the unfavorable atmosphere the colored people are
told that whiskey must be used to prevent sickness.
In this way many unfortunate persons are misled
to the degraded habit of drinking excessively.</p>

<p>East Mississippi is usually called the “Hills” by
the inhabitants of the swamp. When any one succeeds
in making good his or her escape, it is by the
“underground railroads,” or a similar channel to that
of the abolitionist in securing colored men and women
into Canada in the days of slavery. Mr. Mark
Coleman, brother of the author of these facts, has
been and is to this day operating the underground
railway line on the Yazoo River. His beginning of
this movement was attended with many experiences
which attended the rugged way of the beloved white
men and women who sympathized for the black man
to the extent of devising a road on which he could
reach the safe shores of Canada.</p>

<p>An investigation of the oppressed people in the
Mississippi Delta is necessary, and is solicited. The
high water of 1897 revealed a part of the destitute
cases near the rivers and railroads, but “Wild
Woods,” and a host of other obscure islands have
never been heard from. The ways of right cannot be
properly diffused among the people of color in the
Mississippi “bottoms.” The word of the Lord should
have free course. Any instruction leading up to higher
morality and Christianity is impeded. The Arkansas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
side of the valley is chiefly barren; especially that
being parallel with the Little Rock and Memphis
railroad. The labor record of the Negro has grown
ever since the landing of 20 at Jamestown, Va., in
1619. “He has made America what it is,” for this
reason the colored people of many Southern States
have been solicited to settle in this vast watery territory
along the L. R &amp; M. R. R. In view of the
hardships which befell those in Mississippi Delta, the
Negro refuses the offer. The refusal of the Negro to
occupy the Arkansas desert is looked upon by his
enemies as being slothful. But this view of the Negro
is commonly taken when he is shrewd enough to
shirk danger. The Oklahoma movement in 1892
was upheld by the colored Southerners with a hope
of reaching a home where equal rights would be imparted
to all. Since their settlement in Oklahoma,
they have fallen victims to the mob and rope bands
of white men, who have made it a famous event to
enter the homes of the black men and overpower
them with war arms, and commit rape on their wives
and daughters. Bishop Turner, in defence of his
race, gave advice that they should protect themselves.
This advice was given in the Voice of Missions, missionary
organ of the A. M. E. Church. Numerous
Northern newspapers endeavored to put the entire
South against the godly Bishop for attempting to
protect <em>the ladies</em> of his race from being destroyed by
night mobs. The Bishop’s <em>idea</em> of family protection
in many <em>unfriendly</em> localities is commendable. The
Indians in the Oklahoma regions and elsewhere have
always protected their families. 25 white citizens of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Oklahoma were killed by Indians in Jan., 1898, by
way of race <em>protection</em>.</p>

<hr />

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">IGNORANCE OF DECENCY AND LIMITED
CHRISTIANITY.</span></h2>

<p>There can be no better method of emphasizing
and clearly establishing the facts which have been
stated on the various subjects preceding <em>this</em>, than to
end syllogistically:</p>

<p>(1) It is obvious that the colored race equals the
white race in decency. They could not wash their
white sister’s clothes without washing for themselves.
They could not cook decently for the white families’
hotels and other public places, if they were not suitable
for the position. Thousands of young men and
women graduating annually, in all the professions and
branches of labor, warrant the fact that the colored
people cope with the white people in intellectual and
industrial progress.</p>

<p>(2) Although about one-half of the colored population
of the United States are followers to some denomination,
yet the so-called Christian white people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of the south, both pulpit and pew, limit Christianity
to themselves and own house.</p>

<p>(3) In consideration of these things, we must
conclude that eating, riding and social gatherings
among the white people is not a desire of the colored
race, and all previous conceptions of such are erroneous,
and will be rectified when our southern white
brethren reach a higher civilization and pure Christianity.</p>

<p>“For the President, Senate and Congress to stand
still and allow any State in the Union to incorporate
laws conflicting with the Constitutional rights of any
of its citizens, is to me a fact that the national government
is too weak to last long.”—<span class="smcap">Rev. S. T. Twigler</span>,
Marion, S. C., Nov. 12, 1897.</p>

<p>An immense volume would be required to write
one-fourth of the lynches in 1892-93—saying nothing
of the other evil. The urgent demand for this book
has contracted it. Other volumes on the questions
embodied in this book may follow this agent of
peace, equal rights, and prosperity.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
